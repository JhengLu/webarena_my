It\nprovides mechanisms for *routing* (mapping request URLs to actions), defining\n*controllers* that implement actions, and generating responses by rendering\n*views*, which are templates of various formats. In short, Action Pack\nprovides the view and controller layers in the MVC paradigm.\nIt consists of several modules:\n* Action Dispatch, which parses information about the web request, handles\n  routing as defined by the user, and does advanced processing related to HTTP\n  such as MIME-type negotiation, decoding parameters in POST, PATCH, or PUT bodies,\n  handling HTTP caching logic, cookies and sessions.\n* Action Controller, which provides a base controller class that can be\n  subclassed to implement filters and actions to handle requests. The result\n  of an action is typically content generated from views.\nWith the Ruby on Rails framework, users only directly interface with the\nAction Controller module. Necessary Action Dispatch functionality is activated\nby default and Action View rendering is implicitly triggered by Action\nController. However, these modules are designed to function on their own and\ncan be used outside of Rails.\nYou can read more about Action Pack in the {Action Controller Overview}[https://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_controller_overview.html] guide.\n== Download and installation\nThe latest version of Action Pack can be installed with RubyGems:\n  $ gem install actionpack\nSource code can be downloaded as part of the Rails project on GitHub:\n* https://github.com/rails/rails/tree/main/actionpack\n== License\nAction Pack is released under the MIT license:\n* https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT\n== Support\nAPI documentation is at:\n* https://api.rubyonrails.org\nBug reports for the Ruby on Rails project can be filed here:\n* https://github.com/rails/rails/issues\nFeature requests should be discussed on the rails-core mailing list here:\n* https://discuss.rubyonrails.org/c/rubyonrails-core\nCopyright (c) 2004-2022 David Heinemeier Hansson\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n\"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND\nNONINFRINGEMENT.

Versions prior to 2.0.0 did not insert escape\ncharacters into attribute values in the XML markup.  This allowed\nattribute values to explicitly reference entities, which was\noccasionally used by a small number of developers.  Since strings\ncould always be explicitly escaped by hand, this was not a major\nrestriction in functionality.\nHowever, it did surprise most users of builder.  Since the body text is\nnormally escaped, everybody expected the attribute values to be\nescaped as well.  Escaped attribute values were the number one support\nrequest on the 1.x Builder series.\nStarting with Builder version 2.0.0, all attribute values expressed as\nstrings will be processed and the appropriate characters will be\nescaped (e.g. \"&\" will be translated to \"&amp;amp;\").  Attribute values\nthat are expressed as Symbol values will not be processed for escaped\ncharacters and will be unchanged in output. (Yes, this probably counts\nas Symbol abuse, but the convention is convenient and flexible).\nExample:\n```ruby\n  xml = Builder::XmlMarkup.new\n  xml.sample(:escaped=>\"This&That\", :unescaped=>:\"Here&amp;There\")\n  xml.target!  =>\n    <sample escaped=\"This&amp;That\" unescaped=\"Here&amp;There\"/>\n```\n### Version 1.0.0 Compatibility Changes\nVersion 1.0.0 introduces some changes that are not backwards\ncompatible with earlier releases of builder.  The main areas of\nincompatibility are:\n* Keyword based arguments to +new+ (rather than positional based).  It\n  was found that a developer would often like to specify indentation\n  without providing an explicit target, or specify a target without\n  indentation.  Keyword based arguments handle this situation nicely.\n* Builder must now be an explicit target for markup tags.  Instead of\n  writing\n```ruby\n    xml_markup = Builder::XmlMarkup.new\n    xml_markup.div { strong(\"text\") }\n```\n  you need to write\n```ruby\n    xml_markup = Builder::XmlMarkup.new\n    xml_markup.div { xml_markup.strong(\"text\") }\n```\n* The builder object is passed as a parameter to all nested markup\n  blocks.  This allows you to create a short alias for the builder\n  object that can be used within the block.  For example, the previous\n  example can be written as:\n```ruby\n    xml_markup = Builder::XmlMarkup.new\n    xml_markup.div { |xml| xml.strong(\"text\") }\n```\n* If you have both a pre-1.0 and a post-1.0 gem of builder installed,\n  you can choose which version to use through the RubyGems\n  +require_gem+ facility.\n```ruby\n    require_gem 'builder', \"~> 0.0\"   # Gets the old version\n    require_gem 'builder', \"~> 1.0\"   # Gets the new version\n```\n## Features\n* XML Comments are supported ...\n```ruby\n    xml_markup.comment! \"This is a comment\"\n      #=>  <!-- This is a comment -->\n```\n* XML processing instructions are supported ...\n```ruby\n    xml_markup.instruct! :xml, :version=>\"1.0\", :encoding=>\"UTF-8\"\n      #=>  <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n```\n  If the processing instruction is omitted, it defaults to \"xml\".\n  When the processing instruction is \"xml\", the defaults attributes\n  are:\n  <b>version</b>: 1.0\n  <b>encoding</b>: \"UTF-8\"\n  (NOTE: if the encoding is set to \"UTF-8\" and $KCODE is set to\n  \"UTF8\", then Builder will emit UTF-8 encoded strings rather than\n  encoding non-ASCII characters as entities.)\n* XML entity declarations are now supported to a small degree.\n```ruby\n    xml_markup.declare! :DOCTYPE, :chapter, :SYSTEM, \"../dtds/chapter.dtd\"\n      #=>  <!DOCTYPE chapter SYSTEM \"../dtds/chapter.dtd\">\n```\n  The parameters to a declare! method must be either symbols or\n  strings. Symbols are inserted without quotes, and strings are\n  inserted with double quotes.  Attribute-like arguments in hashes are\n  not allowed.\n  If you need to have an argument to declare! be inserted without\n  quotes, but the argument does not conform to the typical Ruby\n  syntax for symbols, then use the :\"string\" form to specify a symbol.\n  For example:\n```ruby\n    xml_markup.declare! :ELEMENT, :chapter, :\"(title,para+)\"\n      #=>  <!ELEMENT chapter (title,para+)>\n```\n  Nested entity declarations are allowed.  For example:\n```ruby\n    @xml_markup.declare! :DOCTYPE, :chapter do |x|\n      x.declare! :ELEMENT, :chapter, :\"(title,para+)\"\n      x.declare! :ELEMENT, :title, :\"(#PCDATA)\"\n      x.declare! :ELEMENT, :para, :\"(#PCDATA)\"\n    end\n    #=>\n    <!DOCTYPE chapter [\n      <!ELEMENT chapter (title,para+)>\n      <!ELEMENT title (#PCDATA)>\n      <!ELEMENT para (#PCDATA)>\n    ]>\n```\n* Some support for XML namespaces is now available.  If the first\n  argument to a tag call is a symbol, it will be joined to the tag to\n  produce a namespace:tag combination.  It is easier to show this than\n  describe it.\n```ruby\n   xml.SOAP :Envelope do ... end\n```\n  Just put a space before the colon in a namespace to produce the\n  right form for builder (e.g. \"<tt>SOAP:Envelope</tt>\" =>\n  \"<tt>xml.SOAP :Envelope</tt>\")\n* String attribute values are <em>now</em> escaped by default by\n  Builder (<b>NOTE:</b> this is _new_ behavior as of version 2.0).\n  However, occasionally you need to use entities in attribute values.\n  Using a symbol (rather than a string) for an attribute value will\n  cause Builder to not run its quoting/escaping algorithm on that\n  particular value.\n  (<b>Note:</b> The +escape_attrs+ option for builder is now\n  obsolete).\n  Example:\n```ruby\n    xml = Builder::XmlMarkup.new\n    xml.sample(:escaped=>\"This&That\", :unescaped=>:\"Here&amp;There\")\n    xml.target!  =>\n      <sample escaped=\"This&amp;That\" unescaped=\"Here&amp;There\"/>\n```\n* UTF-8 Support\n  Builder correctly translates UTF-8 characters into valid XML.  (New\n  in version 2.0.0).  Thanks to Sam Ruby for the translation code.\n  You can get UTF-8 encoded output by making sure that the XML\n  encoding is set to \"UTF-8\" and that the $KCODE variable is set to\n  \"UTF8\".\n```ruby\n    $KCODE = 'UTF8'\n    xml = Builder::Markup.new\n    xml.instruct!(:xml, :encoding => \"UTF-8\")\n    xml.sample(\"IÃ±tÃ«rnÃ¢tiÃ´nÃ l\")\n    xml.target!  =>\n      \"<sample>IÃ±tÃ«rnÃ¢tiÃ´nÃ l</sample>\"\n```\n## Links\n| Description | Link |\n| :----: | :----: |\n| Documents           | http://builder.rubyforge.org/ |\n| Github Clone        | git://github.com/tenderlove/builder.git |\n| Issue / Bug Reports | https://github.com/tenderlove/builder/issues?state=open |\n## Contact\n| Description | Value                  |\n| :----:      | :----:                 |\n| Author      | Jim Weirich            |\n| Email       | jim.weirich@gmail.com  |\n| Home Page   | http://onestepback.org |\n| License     | MIT Licence (http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.html) |\nCopyright (c) 2003-2012 Jim Weirich (jim.weirich@gmail.com)\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n\"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND\nNONINFRINGEMENT.

Net::HTTP::Persistent wraps Net::HTTP and allows you to\nfocus on how to make HTTP requests.\n== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:\n* Supports TLS with secure defaults\n* Thread-safe\n* Pure ruby\n== SYNOPSIS\nThe following example will make two requests to the same server.  The\nconnection is kept alive between requests:\n    require 'net/http/persistent'\n    uri = URI 'http://example.com/awesome/web/service'\n    http = Net::HTTP::Persistent.new name: 'my_app_name'\n    # perform a GET\n    response = http.request uri\n    # create a POST\n    post_uri = uri + 'create'\n    post = Net::HTTP::Post.new post_uri.path\n    post.set_form_data 'some' => 'cool data'\n    # perform the POST, the URI is always required\n    response = http.request post_uri, post\n    # if you are done making http requests, or won't make requests for several\n    # minutes\n    http.shutdown\nPlease see the documentation on Net::HTTP::Persistent for more information,\nincluding SSL connection verification, header handling and tunable options.\n== INSTALL:\n  gem install net-http-persistent\n== LICENSE:\n(The MIT License)\nCopyright (c) Eric Hodel, Aaron Patterson\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\nThe MIT License\nPortions copyright (c) 2010-2019 AndrÃ© Arko\nPortions copyright (c) 2009 Engine Yard\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

This code is distributed with\nlibffi for the purpose of convenience only, and libffi is in no way\nderived from this code.\nmsvcc.sh an testsuite/libffi.bhaible are both distributed under the\nterms of the GNU GPL version 2, as below.\n                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n                       Version 2, June 1991\n Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,\n 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA\n Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n                            Preamble\n  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\nfreedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n                            NO WARRANTY\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Of course, the commands you use may\nbe called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be\nmouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\nnecessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\n  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program\n  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\n  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989\n  Ty Coon, President of Vice\nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\nproprietary programs.

If you have an older\nversion of Ruby installed, you can update via Homebrew:\n```sh\n$ ruby -e \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)\"\n```\nthen:\n```sh\n$ brew install ruby\n```\nThe easiest way to use `license_finder` is to install it as a command\nline tool, like brew, awk, gem or bundler:\n```sh\n$ gem install license_finder\n```\nThough it's less preferable, if you are using bundler in a Ruby\nproject, you can add `license_finder` to your Gemfile:\n```ruby\ngem 'license_finder', :group => :development\n```\nThis approach helps you remember to install `license_finder`, but can\npull in unwanted dependencies, including `bundler`. To mitigate this\nproblem, see [Excluding Dependencies](#excluding-dependencies).\n## Usage\nMake sure your dependencies are installed (with your package manager's install command: `bundle install`, `npm install`, etc.)\nThe first time you run `license_finder` it will list all your project's packages.\n```sh\n$ license_finder\n```\nOr, if you installed with bundler:\n```sh\n$ bundle exec license_finder\n```\nThe output will report that none of your packages have been\napproved.  Over time you will tell `license_finder` which packages\nare approved, so when you run this command in the future, it will\nreport current action items; i.e., packages that are new or have\nnever been approved.\nIf you don't wish to see progressive output \"dots\", use the `--quiet`\noption.\nIf you'd like to see debugging output, use the `--debug`\noption. `license_finder` will then output info about packages, their\ndependencies, and where and how each license was discovered. This can\nbe useful when you need to track down an unexpected package or\nlicense.\nIf you do not want to manually run an individual package manager's prepare\ncommand (ex: `bundle install`, `npm install`, etc) to ensure your project\nis fully prepared to be scanned, use the `--prepare` or `-p` option which will run\neach active package manager's prepare command for you. If you would like to continue\nrunning `license_finder` even if there is an issue with a prepare step, use the\n`--prepare-no-fail` option which prepares but carries on despite any potential failures.\nRun `license_finder help` to see other available commands, and\n`license_finder help [COMMAND]` for detailed help on a specific\ncommand.\n### Docker\nIf you have docker installed, try using the included `dlf` script (potentially\nsymlinked to be in your path via `ln -s LicenseFinder/dlf /usr/local/bin` or\nwhatever method you prefer). This will run any commands passed to it inside a\npre-provisioned Docker container to maintain consistent versions of all the\npackage managers. For example,\n```\n$ dlf npm --version\n5.3.0\n$ dlf license_finder --help\nDependencies that need approval:\n...\nlicense_finder, 3.0.3, MIT\n$ dlf \"bundle install && license_finder\"\n```\nYou can better understand the way this script works by looking at its source, but for\nreference it will mount your current directory at the path `/scan` and run any commands\npassed to it from that directory.\nNote that the docker image will run the gem which is installed within it.\nSo the docker image tagged `4.0.2` will run *License Finder Version 4.0.2*\nSee the [contributing guide](https://github.com/pivotal/LicenseFinder/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for information on development. \n### Activation\n`license_finder` will find and include packages for all supported\nlanguages, as long as that language has a package definition in the project directory:\n* `Gemfile` (for `bundler`)\n* `requirements.txt` (for `pip`)\n* `package.json` (for `npm`)\n* `pom.xml` (for `maven`)\n* `build.gradle` (for `gradle`)\n* `settings.gradle` that specifies `rootProject.buildFileName` (for `gradle`)\n* `bower.json` (for `bower`)\n* `Podfile` (for `pod`)\n* `Cartfile` (for `carthage`)\n* `workspace-state.json` under build directory (provided as enviroment variable `SPM_DERIVED_DATA` for Xcode, or default `.build` for non-Xcode projects), (for `spm`)\n* `rebar.config` (for `rebar`)\n* `Erlang.mk` or `erlang.mk` file (for `Erlang.mk`)\n* `mix.exs` (for `mix`)\n* `packages/` directory (for `nuget`)\n* `*.csproj` (for `dotnet`)\n* `vendor/manifest` or `*/vendor/manifest` file (for `gvt`)\n* `glide.lock` file (for `glide`)\n* `vendor/vendor.json` file (for `govendor`)\n* `Gopkg.lock` file (for `dep`)\n* `go.mod` file (for `go mod`)\n* `vendor.conf` file (for `trash`)\n* `yarn.lock` file (for `yarn`)\n* `conanfile.txt` file (for `conan`)\n* `build.sbt` file (for `sbt`)\n* `Cargo.lock` file (for `cargo`)\n* `composer.lock` file (for `composer`)\n### Continuous Integration\n`license_finder` will return a non-zero exit status if there are unapproved\ndependencies. This can be useful for inclusion in a CI environment to alert you\nif someone adds an unapproved dependency to the project.\n## Approving Dependencies\n`license_finder` will inform you whenever you have an unapproved dependency.\nIf your business decides this is an acceptable risk, the easiest way to approve\nthe dependency is by running `license_finder approvals add`.\nFor example, let's assume you've added the `awesome_gpl_gem`\nto your Gemfile, which `license_finder` reports is unapproved:\n```sh\n$ license_finder\nDependencies that need approval:\nawesome_gpl_gem, 1.0.0, GPL\n```\nYour business tells you that in this case, it's acceptable to use this\ngem. You now run:\n```sh\n$ license_finder approvals add awesome_gpl_gem\n```\nIf you rerun `license_finder`, you should no longer see\n`awesome_gpl_gem` in the output.\nTo approve specific version\n```sh\n$ license_finder approvals add awesome_gpl_gem --version=1.0.0\n```\nTo record who approved the dependency and why:\n```sh\n$ license_finder approvals add awesome_gpl_gem --who CTO --why \"Go ahead\"\n```\n### Permitting Licenses\nApproving packages one-by-one can be tedious.  Usually your business has\nblanket policies about which packages are approved.  To tell `license_finder`\nthat any package with the MIT license should be approved, run:\n``` sh\n$ license_finder permitted_licenses add MIT\n```\nAny current or future packages with the MIT license will be excluded from the\noutput of `license_finder`.\nYou can also record `--who` and `--why` when changing permitted licenses,\nor making any other decision about your project.\n## Output and Artifacts\n### Decisions file\nAny decisions you make about approvals will be recorded in a YAML file named\n`doc/dependency_decisions.yml`.\nThis file must be committed to version control.  Rarely, you will have to\nmanually resolve conflicts in it.  In this situation, keep in mind that each\ndecision has an associated timestamp, and the decisions are processed\ntop-to-bottom, with later decisions overwriting or appending to earlier\ndecisions.\n### Output from `action_items`\nYou could expect `license_finder`, which is an alias for `license_finder\naction_items` to output something like the following on a Rails project where\nMIT had been permitted:\n```\nDependencies that need approval:\nhighline, 1.6.14, ruby\njson, 1.7.5, ruby\nmime-types, 1.19, ruby\nrails, 3.2.8, unknown\nrdoc, 3.12, unknown\nrubyzip, 0.9.9, ruby\nxml-simple, 1.1.1, unknown\n```\nYou can customize the format of the output in the same way that you customize\n[output from `report`](#output-from-report).\n### Output from `project_roots`\nThe `license_finder project_roots` command will output the current working directory as a string in an array.\nUsing the `--recursive` option means the array will include subdirectories that contain a known package manager. With the exception that Gradle and Maven subprojects will not be included.\n### Output from `report`\nThe `license_finder report` command will output human-readable reports that you\ncould send to your non-technical business partners, lawyers, etc.  You can\nchoose the format of the report (text, csv, html or markdown); see\n`license_finder --help report` for details.  The output is sent to STDOUT, so\nyou can save the reports wherever you want them.  You can commit them to\nversion control if you like.\nThe HTML report generated by `license_finder report --format html` summarizes\nall of your project's dependencies and includes information about which need to\nbe approved. The project name at the top of the report can be set with\n`license_finder project_name add`.\n### Note:\nWhen using the yarn package manager, when a node_module's package.json doesn't\nexplicitly declare a license, yarn indicates that it has inferred the license based\non some keywords in other files by appending an asterisk to the license name. If you\nsee a * at the end of the license name, this is intended.\nSee [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/pivotal/LicenseFinder/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#adding-reports)\nfor advice about adding and customizing reports.\n## Manual Intervention\n### Setting Licenses\nWhen `license_finder` reports that a dependency's license is 'unknown',\nyou should manually research what the actual license is.  When you\nhave established the real license, you can record it with:\n```sh\n$ license_finder licenses add my_unknown_dependency MIT --homepage=\"www.unknown-code.org\"\n```\nThis command would assign the MIT license to the dependency\n`my_unknown_dependency`. It will also set its homepage to `www.unknown-code.org`.\n### Adding Hidden Dependencies\n`license_finder` can track dependencies that your package managers\ndon't know about (JS libraries that don't appear in your\nGemfile/requirements.txt/package.json, etc.)\n```sh\n$ license_finder dependencies add my_js_dep MIT 0.1.2\n```\nRun `license_finder dependencies help` for\nadditional documentation about managing these dependencies.\n`license_finder` cannot automatically detect when one of these\ndependencies has been removed from your project, so you can use:\n```sh\n$ license_finder dependencies remove my_js_dep\n```\n### Excluding Dependencies\nSometimes a project will have development or test dependencies which\nyou don't want to track.  You can exclude theses dependencies by running\n`license_finder ignored_groups`.  (Currently this only works for packages\nmanaged by Bundler, NPM, Yarn, Maven, Pip2, Pip3, and Nuget.)\nOn rare occasions a package manager will report an individual dependency\nthat you want to exclude from all reports, even though it is approved.\nYou can exclude an individual dependency by running\n`license_finder ignored_dependencies`.  Think carefully before adding\ndependencies to this list.  A likely item to exclude is `bundler`,\nsince it is a common dependency whose version changes from machine to\nmachine.  Adding it to the `ignored_dependencies` would prevent it\n(and its oscillating versions) from appearing in reports.\n### Restricting Licenses\nSome projects will have a list of licenses that cannot be used.  You can\nrestrict these licenses with `license_finder restricted_licenses add`.  Any dependency\nthat has exclusively restricted licenses will always appear in the action\nitems, even if someone attempts to manually approve or permit it.  However,\nif a dependency has even one license that is not restricted, it can still be\nmanually approved or permitted.\n## Decision inheritance\nAdd or remove decision files you want to inherit from - see `license_finder inherited_decisions help` for more information.\nThis allows you to have a centralized decision file for approved/restricted licenses. If you have multiple projects it's way easier to have one single place where you approved or restricted licenses defined.\nAdd one or more decision files to the inherited decisions\n```bash\nlicense_finder inherited_decisions add DECISION_FILE\n```\nRemove one or more decision files from the inherited decisions\n```bash\nlicense_finder inherited_decisions remove DECISION_FILE\n```\nList all the inherited decision files\n```bash\nlicense_finder inherited_decisions list\n```\n## Configuration\nBe default, `license_finder` expects the decisions file to be stored at\n`doc/dependency_decisions.yml`.  All commands can be passed `--decisions_file`\nto override this location.\n### Package Manager Configuration\nIf you have a gradle project, you can invoke gradle with a custom script by\npassing (for example) `--gradle_command gradlew` to `license_finder` or\n`license_finder report`.\nSimilarly you can invoke a custom rebar script with `--rebar_command rebar`.\nIf you store rebar dependencies in a custom directory (by setting `deps_dir` in\n`rebar.config`), set `--rebar_deps_dir`.\nYou can also invoke a custom Mix script `remix` with `--mix_command remix` and\nset `--mix_deps_dir` to fetch Mix dependencies from a custom directory.\n### Narrow down Package Manager\nBy default, license_finder will check for all supported package managers,\nbut you can narrow it down to use only those you pass to `--enabled-package-managers`.\nFor example,\n```\n$ license_finder --enabled-package-managers bundler npm\n```\n### Saving Configuration\nIt may be difficult to remember to pass command line options to every command.\nIn some of these cases you can store default values in a YAML formatted config\nfile. `license_finder` looks for this file in `config/license_finder.yml`.\nAs an example, the file might look like this:\n```yaml\n---\ndecisions_file: './some_path/decisions.yml'\ngradle_command: './gradlew'\nrebar_command: './rebarw'\nrebar_deps_dir: './rebar_deps'\nmix_command: './mixw'\nmix_deps_dir: './mix_deps'\nenabled_package_managers:\n  - bundler\n  - gradle\n  - rebar\n  - mix\n```\n### Gradle Projects\n`license_finder` supports both Gradle 1.x and Gradle 2.x. You need to have installed\nthe license-gradle-plugin in your project:\n[https://github.com/hierynomus/license-gradle-plugin](https://github.com/hierynomus/license-gradle-plugin)\nBy default, `license_finder` will report on Gradle's \"runtime\" dependencies. If\nyou want to generate a report for some other dependency configuration (e.g.\nAndroid projects will sometimes specify their meaningful dependencies in the\n\"compile\" group), you can specify it in your project's `build.gradle`:\n```\n// Must come *after* applying the appropriate plugin from [https://github.com/hierynomus/license-gradle-plugin](https://github.com/hierynomus/license-gradle-plugin)\ndownloadLicenses {\n  dependencyConfiguration \"compile\"\n}\n```\n### Conan Projects\n`license_finder` supports Conan. You need to have the following lines in your conanfile.txt for `license_finder` to retrieve dependencies' licenses.\nEnsure that `conan install` does not generate an error.\n```\n[imports]\n., license* -> ./licenses @ folder=True, ignore_case=True\n```\n### SBT Projects\n`license_finder` supports SBT. You need to have installed the sbt-license-report in your project:\n[https://github.com/sbt/sbt-license-report](https://github.com/sbt/sbt-license-report)\nBy default, `license_finder` will report on SBT's \"compile\" and \"test\" dependencies. If\nyou want to generate a report for some other dependency configuration, you can specify\nit in your projects's `build.sbt`\n```\nlicenseConfigurations := Set(\"compile\", \"provided\")\n```\n## Requirements\n`license_finder` requires ruby >= 1.9.3, or jruby.\n## Upgrading\nTo upgrade to `license_finder` version >= 6.0, you have to replace the terminology `whitelist` with `permit` and  `blacklist` with `restrict` in your `dependency_decisions.yml`. See [Changelog](https://github.com/pivotal/LicenseFinder/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#600--2020-01-22) for more details.\nTo upgrade from `license_finder` version 1.2 to 2.0, see\n[`license_finder_upgrade`](https://github.com/mainej/license_finder_upgrade).\nTo upgrade to 2.0 from a version lower than 1.2, first upgrade to 1.2, and run\n`license_finder` at least once.  This will ensure that the `license_finder`\ndatabase is in a state which `license_finder_upgrade` understands.\n## A Plea to Package Authors and Maintainers\nPlease add a license to your package specs! Most packaging systems\nallow for the specification of one or more licenses.\nFor example, Ruby Gems can specify a license by name:\n```ruby\nGem::Specification.new do |s|\n  s.name = \"my_great_gem\"\n  s.license = \"MIT\"\nend\n```\nAnd save a `LICENSE` file which contains your license text in your repo.\n## Known issues with specific package managers\n* Bundler\n   * When using `--project-path`, Bundler cannot find the Gemfile.\n* Yarn\n   * A module that is incompatible with the platform on which\n     license_finder is run will always be reported to have a license type\n     of \"unknown\".

By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n                            NO WARRANTY\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along\n    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,\n    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this\nwhen it starts in an interactive mode:\n    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author\n    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may\nbe called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be\nmouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\nnecessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\n  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program\n  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\n  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989\n  Ty Coon, President of Vice\nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\nproprietary programs.

ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM\nCONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.\n1. DEFINITIONS\n\"Contribution\" means:\n     a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and\n     documentation distributed under this Agreement, and\n     b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:\n          i) changes to the Program, and\n          ii) additions to the Program;\nwhere such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are\ndistributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a\nContributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or\nanyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include\nadditions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software\ndistributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement,\nand (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.\n\"Contributor\" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.\n\"Licensed Patents\" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are\nnecessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when\ncombined with the Program.\n\"Program\" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this\nAgreement.\n\"Recipient\" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,\nincluding all Contributors.\n2. GRANT OF RIGHTS\n     a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants\n     Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to\n     reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly\n     perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor,\n     if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.\n     b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants\n     Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under\n     Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise\n     transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and\n     object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of\n     the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is\n     added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such\n     combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license\n     shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution.\n     No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.\n     c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the\n     licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are\n     provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent\n     or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each\n     Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by\n     any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or\n     otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted\n     hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure\n     any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a\n     third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute\n     the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license\n     before distributing the Program.\n     d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient\n     copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright\n     license set forth in this Agreement.\n3. REQUIREMENTS\nA Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under\nits own license agreement, provided that:\n     a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and\n     b) its license agreement:\n          i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all\n          warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties\n          or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties\n          or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular\n          purpose;\n          ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability\n          for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and\n          consequential damages, such as lost profits;\n          iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are\n          offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and\n          iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such\n          Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable\n          manner on or through a medium customarily used for software\n          exchange.\nWhen the Program is made available in source code form:\n     a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and\n     b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the\n     Program.\nContributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within\nthe Program.\nEach Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution,\nif any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify\nthe originator of the Contribution.\n4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\nCommercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with\nrespect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is\nintended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who\nincludes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner\nwhich does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore,\nif a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such\nContributor (\"Commercial Contributor\") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify\nevery other Contributor (\"Indemnified Contributor\") against any losses,\ndamages and costs (collectively \"Losses\") arising from claims, lawsuits and\nother legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified\nContributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial\nContributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial\nproduct offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims\nor Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property\ninfringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a)\npromptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b)\nallow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial\nContributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The\nIndemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.\nFor example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product\noffering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If\nthat Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers\nwarranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are\nsuch Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the\nCommercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other\nContributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a\ncourt requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the\nCommercial Contributor must pay those damages.\n5. NO WARRANTY\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN\n\"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,\nNON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each\nRecipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using\nand distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its\nexercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to the\nrisks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to\nor loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of\noperations.\n6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY\nCONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,\nSPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION\nLOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN\nCONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)\nARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE\nEXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY\nOF SUCH DAMAGES.\n7. GENERAL\nIf any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under\napplicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the\nremainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the\nparties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent\nnecessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\nIf Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a\ncross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself\n(excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware)\ninfringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted\nunder Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\nAll Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to\ncomply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does\nnot cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of\nsuch noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate,\nRecipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as\nreasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement\nand any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue\nand survive.\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in\norder to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be\nmodified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to\npublish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to\ntime. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this\nAgreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The\nEclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement\nSteward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will\nbe given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including\nContributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the\nAgreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the\nAgreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program\n(including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly\nstated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or\nlicenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement,\nwhether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the\nProgram not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.\nThis Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the\nintellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this\nAgreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year\nafter the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial\nin any resulting litigation.\n---\ntitle: Apache License 2.0\nspdx-id: Apache-2.0\nredirect_from: /licenses/apache/\nfeatured: true\nhidden: false\ndescription: A permissive license whose main conditions require preservation of copyright and license notices.

No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the\ndistribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.\nNotwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a\nContributor:\n(a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;\n    or\n(b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's\n    modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its\n    Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor\n    Version); or\n(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of\n    its Contributions.\nThis License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,\nor logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with\nthe notice requirements in Section 3.4).\n2.4.

You must inform recipients that the Source\nCode Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this\nLicense, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not\nattempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code\nForm.\n3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\nIf You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\n(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code\n    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of\n    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code\n    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more\n    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and\n(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this\n    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the\n    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter\n    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\n3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work\nYou may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,\nprovided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for\nthe Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered\nSoftware with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the\nCovered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this\nLicense permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software\nunder the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of\nthe Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered\nSoftware under the terms of either this License or such Secondary\nLicense(s).\n3.4.

Application of Additional Terms\nYou may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,\nindemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered\nSoftware. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on\nbehalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any\nsuch warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by\nYou alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any\nliability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,\nindemnity or liability terms You offer.

Additional Definitions.\n  As used herein, \"this License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, and the \"GNU GPL\" refers to version 3 of the GNU\nGeneral Public License.\n  \"The Library\" refers to a covered work governed by this License,\nother than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.\n  An \"Application\" is any work that makes use of an interface provided\nby the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.\nDefining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode\nof using an interface provided by the Library.\n  A \"Combined Work\" is a work produced by combining or linking an\nApplication with the Library.  The particular version of the Library\nwith which the Combined Work was made is also called the \"Linked\nVersion\".\n  The \"Minimal Corresponding Source\" for a Combined Work means the\nCorresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code\nfor portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are\nbased on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.\n  The \"Corresponding Application Code\" for a Combined Work means the\nobject code and/or source code for the Application, including any data\nand utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the\nApplication, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.\n  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License\nwithout being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n  2. Conveying Modified Versions.\n  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a\nfacility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application\nthat uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the\nfacility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified\nversion:\n   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to\n   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the\n   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs\n   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\n   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of\n   this License applicable to that copy.\n  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.\n  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from\na header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object\ncode under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated\nmaterial is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure\nlayouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates\n(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the\n   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n  4. Combined Works.\n  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,\ntaken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the\nportions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of\nthe following:\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that\n   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during\n   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among\n   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the\n   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n   d) Do one of the following:\n       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this\n       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form\n       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to\n       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of\n       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the\n       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying\n       Corresponding Source.\n       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time\n       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer\n       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version\n       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked\n       Version.\n   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise\n   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the\n   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is\n   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the\n   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the\n   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If\n   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany\n   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application\n   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation\n   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL\n   for conveying Corresponding Source.)\n  5. Combined Libraries.\n  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side by side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this\nLicense, and convey such a combined library under terms of your\nchoice, if you do both of the following:\n   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based\n   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,\n   conveyed under the terms of this License.\n   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it\n   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the\n   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new\nversions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\ndiffer in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the\nLibrary as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License \"or any later version\"\napplies to it, you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that published version or of any later version\npublished by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you\nreceived it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide\nwhether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall\napply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is\npermanent authorization for you to choose that version for the\nLibrary.\n---\ntitle: GNU General Public License v3.0\nspdx-id: GPL-3.0\nnickname: GNU GPLv3\nredirect_from: /licenses/gpl-v3/\nfeatured: true\nhidden: false\ndescription: Permissions of this strong copyleft license are conditioned on making available complete source code of licensed works and modifications, which include larger works using a licensed work, under the same license.

By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n  0. Definitions.\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n  1. Source Code.\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n  7. Additional Terms.\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n  8. Termination.\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n  11. Patents.\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\nnotice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands\nmight be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".\n  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see\n<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\ninto proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you\nmay consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with\nthe library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License.  But first, please read\n<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html>.\n---\ntitle: BSD 2-Clause \"Simplified\" License\nspdx-id: BSD-2-Clause\nredirect_from: /licenses/bsd/\nhidden: false\ndescription: A permissive license that comes in two variants, the <a href=\"/licenses/bsd-2-clause/\">BSD 2-Clause</a> and <a href=\"/licenses/bsd-3-clause/\">BSD 3-Clause</a>.

To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention\nof, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently,\nirrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of\nAffirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes\nof action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as\nfuture claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories\nworldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or\ntreaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future\nmedium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever,\nincluding without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional\npurposes (the \"Waiver\"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each\nmember of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and\nsuccessors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to\nrevocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or\nequitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public\nas contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.\n3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason\nbe judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the\nWaiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into\naccount Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the\nextent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected\nperson a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,\nirrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and\nRelated Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the\nmaximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future\ntime extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number\nof copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without\nlimitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the\n\"License\"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was\napplied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any\nreason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such\npartial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder\nof the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she\nwill not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related\nRights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of\naction with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's\nexpress Statement of Purpose.\n4. Limitations and Disclaimers.\n a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,\n    surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.\n b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or\n    warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied,\n    statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of\n    title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non\n    infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or\n    the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to\n    the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.\n c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons\n    that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without\n    limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.\n    Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary\n    consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the\n    Work.\n d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a\n    party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to\n    this CC0 or use of the Work.\nMIT License\nCopyright (c) 2016 Ben Balter\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\nTo protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\nDevelopers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\nFor the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\nSome devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\nFinally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n0. Definitions.\n\"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\nTo \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\nA \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\nTo \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\nTo \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\nAn interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n1. Source Code.\nThe \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\nA \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\nThe \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\nThe \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\nThe Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\nThe Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n2. Basic Permissions.\nAll rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\nYou may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\nConveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\nNo covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\nWhen you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\nYou may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\nYou may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\nYou may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\na) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\nit, and giving a relevant date.\nb) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\nreleased under this License and any conditions added under section\n7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n\"keep intact all notices\".\nc) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\nLicense to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\nLicense will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\nadditional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\nregardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\npermission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\ninvalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\nd) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\nAppropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\ninterfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\nwork need not make them do so.\nA compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\nYou may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\na) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\nCorresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\ncustomarily used for software interchange.\nb) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\nwritten offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\nlong as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\nmodel, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\ncopy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\nproduct that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\nmedium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\nmore than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\nconveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\nCorresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\nc) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\nwritten offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\nalternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\nonly if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\nwith subsection 6b.\nd) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\nplace (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\nCorresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\nfurther charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\nCorresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\ncopy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\nmay be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\nthat supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\nclear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\nCorresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\nCorresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\navailable for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\ne) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\nyou inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\nSource of the work are being offered to the general public at no\ncharge under subsection 6d.\nA separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\nA \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\nIf you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\nThe requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\nCorresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n7. Additional Terms.\n\"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\nWhen you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\na) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\nterms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\nb) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\nauthor attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\nNotices displayed by works containing it; or\nc) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\nrequiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\nreasonable ways as different from the original version; or\nd) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\nauthors of the material; or\ne) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\ntrade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\nf) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\nmaterial by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\nit) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\nany liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\nthose licensors and authors.\nAll other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\nIf you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\nAdditional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n8. Termination.\nYou may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\nHowever, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\nMoreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\nTermination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\nYou are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\nEach time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\nAn \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\nYou may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n11. Patents.\nA \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\nA contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\nEach contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\nIn the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\nIf you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\nIf, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\nA patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\nNothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\nIf conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n14. Revised Versions of this License.\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\nIf the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\nLater license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\nTHERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n16. Limitation of Liability.\nIN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\nIf the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n{one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.}\nCopyright (C) {year}  {name of author}\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\nthe Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n(at your option) any later version.\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\nGNU General Public License for more details.\nYou should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\nalong with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\nIf the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\nnotice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n{project}  Copyright (C) {year}  {fullname}\nThis program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\nThis is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\nunder certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands\nmight be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see\n<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\nThe GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\ninto proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you\nmay consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with\nthe library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License.

DISTRIBUTION OF THIS DOCUMENT DOES NOT CREATE AN\n    ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS\n    INFORMATION ON AN \"AS-IS\" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES\n    REGARDING THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS\n    PROVIDED HEREUNDER, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM\n    THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED\n    HEREUNDER.\nStatement of Purpose\nThe laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer\nexclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator\nand subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an \"owner\") of an original work of\nauthorship and/or a database (each, a \"Work\").\nCertain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for\nthe purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and\nscientific works (\"Commons\") that the public can reliably and without fear\nof later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other\nworks, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever\nand for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes.\nThese owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free\nculture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific\nworks, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in\npart through the use and efforts of others.\nFor these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any\nexpectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person\nassociating CC0 with a Work (the \"Affirmer\"), to the extent that he or she\nis an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily\nelects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its\nterms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the\nWork and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.\n1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be\nprotected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (\"Copyright and\nRelated Rights\"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not\nlimited to, the following:\n  i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,\n     communicate, and translate a Work;\n ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);\niii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or\n     likeness depicted in a Work;\n iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,\n     subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;\n  v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data\n     in a Work;\n vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the\n     European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal\n     protection of databases, and under any national implementation\n     thereof, including any amended or successor version of such\n     directive); and\nvii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the\n     world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national\n     implementations thereof.\n2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention\nof, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently,\nirrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of\nAffirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes\nof action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as\nfuture claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories\nworldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or\ntreaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future\nmedium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever,\nincluding without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional\npurposes (the \"Waiver\"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each\nmember of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and\nsuccessors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to\nrevocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or\nequitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public\nas contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.\n3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason\nbe judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the\nWaiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into\naccount Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the\nextent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected\nperson a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,\nirrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and\nRelated Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the\nmaximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future\ntime extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number\nof copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without\nlimitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the\n\"License\"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was\napplied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any\nreason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such\npartial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder\nof the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she\nwill not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related\nRights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of\naction with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's\nexpress Statement of Purpose.\n4.

Additional Definitions.\nAs used herein, \"this License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, and the \"GNU GPL\" refers to version 3 of the GNU\nGeneral Public License.\n\"The Library\" refers to a covered work governed by this License,\nother than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.\nAn \"Application\" is any work that makes use of an interface provided\nby the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.\nDefining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode\nof using an interface provided by the Library.\nA \"Combined Work\" is a work produced by combining or linking an\nApplication with the Library.  The particular version of the Library\nwith which the Combined Work was made is also called the \"Linked\nVersion\".\nThe \"Minimal Corresponding Source\" for a Combined Work means the\nCorresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code\nfor portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are\nbased on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.\nThe \"Corresponding Application Code\" for a Combined Work means the\nobject code and/or source code for the Application, including any data\nand utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the\nApplication, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.\n1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\nYou may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License\nwithout being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n2. Conveying Modified Versions.\nIf you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a\nfacility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application\nthat uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the\nfacility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified\nversion:\na) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to\nensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the\nfunction or data, the facility still operates, and performs\nwhatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\nb) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of\nthis License applicable to that copy.\n3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.\nThe object code form of an Application may incorporate material from\na header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object\ncode under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated\nmaterial is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure\nlayouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates\n(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:\na) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the\nLibrary is used in it and that the Library and its use are\ncovered by this License.\nb) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\ndocument.\n4. Combined Works.\nYou may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,\ntaken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the\nportions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of\nthe following:\na) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that\nthe Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\ncovered by this License.\nb) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\ndocument.\nc) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during\nexecution, include the copyright notice for the Library among\nthese notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the\ncopies of the GNU GPL and this license document.\nd) Do one of the following:\n0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this\nLicense, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form\nsuitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to\nrecombine or relink the Application with a modified version of\nthe Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the\nmanner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying\nCorresponding Source.\n1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\nLibrary.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time\na copy of the Library already present on the user's computer\nsystem, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version\nof the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked\nVersion.\ne) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise\nbe required to provide such information under section 6 of the\nGNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is\nnecessary to install and execute a modified version of the\nCombined Work produced by recombining or relinking the\nApplication with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If\nyou use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany\nthe Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application\nCode. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation\nInformation in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL\nfor conveying Corresponding Source.)\n5. Combined Libraries.\nYou may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side by side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this\nLicense, and convey such a combined library under terms of your\nchoice, if you do both of the following:\na) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based\non the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,\nconveyed under the terms of this License.\nb) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it\nis a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the\naccompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new\nversions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\ndiffer in detail to address new problems or concerns.\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the\nLibrary as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License \"or any later version\"\napplies to it, you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that published version or of any later version\npublished by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you\nreceived it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\nIf the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide\nwhether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall\napply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is\npermanent authorization for you to choose that version for the\nLibrary.\nGNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   Version 3, 29 June 2007\nCopyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\nof this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n        Preamble\nThe GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for\nsoftware and other kinds of works.\nThe licenses for most software and other practical works are designed\nto take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\nTo protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\nDevelopers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\nFor the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\nSome devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\nFinally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n0. Definitions.\n\"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\nTo \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\nA \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\nTo \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\nTo \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\nAn interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n1. Source Code.\nThe \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\nA \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\nThe \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\nThe \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\nThe Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\nThe Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n2. Basic Permissions.\nAll rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\nYou may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\nConveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\nNo covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\nWhen you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\nYou may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\nYou may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\nYou may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\na) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\nit, and giving a relevant date.\nb) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\nreleased under this License and any conditions added under section\n7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n\"keep intact all notices\".\nc) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\nLicense to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\nLicense will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\nadditional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\nregardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\npermission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\ninvalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\nd) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\nAppropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\ninterfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\nwork need not make them do so.\nA compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\nYou may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\na) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\nCorresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\ncustomarily used for software interchange.\nb) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\nwritten offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\nlong as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\nmodel, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\ncopy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\nproduct that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\nmedium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\nmore than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\nconveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\nCorresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\nc) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\nwritten offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\nalternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\nonly if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\nwith subsection 6b.\nd) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\nplace (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\nCorresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\nfurther charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\nCorresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\ncopy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\nmay be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\nthat supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\nclear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\nCorresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\nCorresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\navailable for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\ne) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\nyou inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\nSource of the work are being offered to the general public at no\ncharge under subsection 6d.\nA separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\nA \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\nIf you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\nThe requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\nCorresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n7. Additional Terms.\n\"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\nWhen you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\na) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\nterms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\nb) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\nauthor attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\nNotices displayed by works containing it; or\nc) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\nrequiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\nreasonable ways as different from the original version; or\nd) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\nauthors of the material; or\ne) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\ntrade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\nf) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\nmaterial by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\nit) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\nany liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\nthose licensors and authors.\nAll other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\nIf you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\nAdditional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n8. Termination.\nYou may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\nHowever, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\nMoreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\nTermination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\nYou are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\nEach time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\nAn \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\nYou may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n11. Patents.\nA \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\nA contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\nEach contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\nIn the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\nIf you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\nIf, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\nA patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\nNothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\nIf conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n14. Revised Versions of this License.\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\nIf the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\nLater license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\nTHERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n16. Limitation of Liability.\nIN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\nIf the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n{one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.}\nCopyright (C) {year}  {name of author}\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\nthe Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n(at your option) any later version.\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\nGNU General Public License for more details.\nYou should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\nalong with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\nIf the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\nnotice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n{project}  Copyright (C) {year}  {fullname}\nThis program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\nThis is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\nunder certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands\nmight be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see\n<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\nThe GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\ninto proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you\nmay consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with\nthe library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License.

Kirk Haines and I were\n     paired up and we cracked open the code for a few test\n     frameworks...\n     I MUST say that minitest is *very* readable / understandable\n     compared to the 'other two' options we looked at. Nicely done and\n     thank you for helping us keep our mental sanity.\"\n    -- Wayne E. Seguin\nminitest/test is a small and incredibly fast unit testing framework.\nIt provides a rich set of assertions to make your tests clean and\nreadable.\nminitest/spec is a functionally complete spec engine. It hooks onto\nminitest/test and seamlessly bridges test assertions over to spec\nexpectations.\nminitest/benchmark is an awesome way to assert the performance of your\nalgorithms in a repeatable manner. Now you can assert that your newb\nco-worker doesn't replace your linear algorithm with an exponential\none!\nminitest/mock by Steven Baker, is a beautifully tiny mock (and stub)\nobject framework.\nminitest/pride shows pride in testing and adds coloring to your test\noutput. I guess it is an example of how to write IO pipes too. :P\nminitest/test is meant to have a clean implementation for language\nimplementors that need a minimal set of methods to bootstrap a working\ntest suite. For example, there is no magic involved for test-case\ndiscovery.\n    \"Again, I can't praise enough the idea of a testing/specing\n     framework that I can actually read in full in one sitting!\"\n    -- Piotr Szotkowski\nComparing to rspec:\n    rspec is a testing DSL. minitest is ruby.\n    -- Adam Hawkins, \"Bow Before MiniTest\"\nminitest doesn't reinvent anything that ruby already provides, like:\nclasses, modules, inheritance, methods. This means you only have to\nlearn ruby to use minitest and all of your regular OO practices like\nextract-method refactorings still apply.\n== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:\n* minitest/autorun - the easy and explicit way to run all your tests.\n* minitest/test - a very fast, simple, and clean test system.\n* minitest/spec - a very fast, simple, and clean spec system.\n* minitest/mock - a simple and clean mock/stub system.\n* minitest/benchmark - an awesome way to assert your algorithm's performance.\n* minitest/pride - show your pride in testing!\n* minitest/test_task - a full-featured and clean rake task generator.\n* Incredibly small and fast runner, but no bells and whistles.\n* Written by squishy human beings. Software can never be perfect. We will all eventually die.\n== RATIONALE:\nSee design_rationale.rb to see how specs and tests work in minitest.\n== SYNOPSIS:\nGiven that you'd like to test the following class:\n  class Meme\n    def i_can_has_cheezburger?\n      \"OHAI!\"\n    end\n    def will_it_blend?\n      \"YES!\"\n    end\n  end\n=== Unit tests\nDefine your tests as methods beginning with +test_+.\n  require \"minitest/autorun\"\n  class TestMeme < Minitest::Test\n    def setup\n      @meme = Meme.new\n    end\n    def test_that_kitty_can_eat\n      assert_equal \"OHAI!\", @meme.i_can_has_cheezburger?\n    end\n    def test_that_it_will_not_blend\n      refute_match /^no/i, @meme.will_it_blend?\n    end\n    def test_that_will_be_skipped\n      skip \"test this later\"\n    end\n  end\n=== Specs\n  require \"minitest/autorun\"\n  describe Meme do\n    before do\n      @meme = Meme.new\n    end\n    describe \"when asked about cheeseburgers\" do\n      it \"must respond positively\" do\n        _(@meme.i_can_has_cheezburger?).must_equal \"OHAI!\"\n      end\n    end\n    describe \"when asked about blending possibilities\" do\n      it \"won't say no\" do\n        _(@meme.will_it_blend?).wont_match /^no/i\n      end\n    end\n  end\nFor matchers support check out:\n* https://github.com/wojtekmach/minitest-matchers\n* https://github.com/rmm5t/minitest-matchers_vaccine\n=== Benchmarks\nAdd benchmarks to your tests.\n  # optionally run benchmarks, good for CI-only work!\n  require \"minitest/benchmark\" if ENV[\"BENCH\"]\n  class TestMeme < Minitest::Benchmark\n    # Override self.bench_range or default range is [1, 10, 100, 1_000, 10_000]\n    def bench_my_algorithm\n      assert_performance_linear 0.9999 do |n| # n is a range value\n        @obj.my_algorithm(n)\n      end\n    end\n  end\nOr add them to your specs. If you make benchmarks optional, you'll\nneed to wrap your benchmarks in a conditional since the methods won't\nbe defined. In minitest 5, the describe name needs to match\n<tt>/Bench(mark)?$/</tt>.\n  describe \"Meme Benchmark\" do\n    if ENV[\"BENCH\"] then\n      bench_performance_linear \"my_algorithm\", 0.9999 do |n|\n        100.times do\n          @obj.my_algorithm(n)\n        end\n      end\n    end\n  end\noutputs something like:\n  # Running benchmarks:\n  TestBlah\t100\t1000\t10000\n  bench_my_algorithm\t 0.006167\t 0.079279\t 0.786993\n  bench_other_algorithm\t 0.061679\t 0.792797\t 7.869932\nOutput is tab-delimited to make it easy to paste into a spreadsheet.\n=== Mocks\nMocks and stubs defined using terminology by Fowler & Meszaros at\nhttps://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/TestDouble.html:\n\"Mocks are pre-programmed with expectations which form a specification\nof the calls they are expected to receive. They can throw an exception\nif they receive a call they don't expect and are checked during\nverification to ensure they got all the calls they were expecting.\"\n  class MemeAsker\n    def initialize(meme)\n      @meme = meme\n    end\n    def ask(question)\n      method = question.tr(\" \", \"_\") + \"?\"\n      @meme.__send__(method)\n    end\n  end\n  require \"minitest/autorun\"\n  describe MemeAsker, :ask do\n    describe \"when passed an unpunctuated question\" do\n      it \"should invoke the appropriate predicate method on the meme\" do\n        @meme = Minitest::Mock.new\n        @meme_asker = MemeAsker.new @meme\n        @meme.expect :will_it_blend?, :return_value\n        @meme_asker.ask \"will it blend\"\n        @meme.verify\n      end\n    end\n  end\n==== Multi-threading and Mocks\nMinitest mocks do not support multi-threading. If it works, fine, if it doesn't\nyou can use regular ruby patterns and facilities like local variables. Here's\nan example of asserting that code inside a thread is run:\n  def test_called_inside_thread\n    called = false\n    pr = Proc.new { called = true }\n    thread = Thread.new(&pr)\n    thread.join\n    assert called, \"proc not called\"\n  end\n=== Stubs\nMocks and stubs are defined using terminology by Fowler & Meszaros at\nhttps://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/TestDouble.html:\n\"Stubs provide canned answers to calls made during the test\".\nMinitest's stub method overrides a single method for the duration of\nthe block.\n  def test_stale_eh\n    obj_under_test = Something.new\n    refute obj_under_test.stale?\n    Time.stub :now, Time.at(0) do   # stub goes away once the block is done\n      assert obj_under_test.stale?\n    end\n  end\nA note on stubbing: In order to stub a method, the method must\nactually exist prior to stubbing. Use a singleton method to create a\nnew non-existing method:\n  def obj_under_test.fake_method\n    ...\n  end\n=== Running Your Tests\nIdeally, you'll use a rake task to run your tests (see below), either\npiecemeal or all at once. BUT! You don't have to:\n    % ruby -Ilib:test test/minitest/test_minitest_test.rb\n    Run options: --seed 37685\n    # Running:\n    ...................................................................... (etc)\n    Finished in 0.107130s, 1446.8403 runs/s, 2959.0217 assertions/s.\n    155 runs, 317 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors, 0 skips\nThere are runtime options available, both from minitest itself, and also\nprovided via plugins.

Show your testing pride!\n        -a, --autotest                   Connect to autotest server.\n=== Rake Tasks\nYou can set up a rake task to run all your tests by adding this to your Rakefile:\n    require \"minitest/test_task\"\n    Minitest::TestTask.create # named test, sensible defaults\n    # or more explicitly:\n    Minitest::TestTask.create(:test) do |t|\n      t.libs << \"test\"\n      t.libs << \"lib\"\n      t.warning = false\n      t.test_globs = [\"test/**/*_test.rb\"]\n    end\n    task :default => :test\nEach of these will generate 4 tasks:\n    rake test          :: Run the test suite.\n    rake test:cmd      :: Print out the test command.\n    rake test:isolated :: Show which test files fail when run separately.\n    rake test:slow     :: Show bottom 25 tests sorted by time.\n=== Rake Task Variables\nThere are a bunch of variables you can supply to rake to modify the run.\n    MT_LIB_EXTRAS :: Extra libs to dynamically override/inject for custom runs.\n    N             :: -n: Tests to run (string or /regexp/).\n    X             :: -x: Tests to exclude (string or /regexp/).\n    A             :: Any extra arguments. Honors shell quoting.\n    MT_CPU        :: How many threads to use for parallel test runs\n    SEED          :: -s --seed Sets random seed.\n    TESTOPTS      :: Deprecated, same as A\n    FILTER        :: Deprecated, same as A\n== Writing Extensions\nTo define a plugin, add a file named minitest/XXX_plugin.rb to your\nproject/gem. That file must be discoverable via ruby's LOAD_PATH (via\nrubygems or otherwise). Minitest will find and require that file using\nGem.find_files. It will then try to call +plugin_XXX_init+ during\nstartup. The option processor will also try to call +plugin_XXX_options+\npassing the OptionParser instance and the current options hash. This\nlets you register your own command-line options. Here's a totally\nbogus example:\n    # minitest/bogus_plugin.rb:\n    module Minitest\n      def self.plugin_bogus_options(opts, options)\n        opts.on \"--myci\", \"Report results to my CI\" do\n          options[:myci] = true\n          options[:myci_addr] = get_myci_addr\n          options[:myci_port] = get_myci_port\n        end\n      end\n      def self.plugin_bogus_init(options)\n        self.reporter << MyCI.new(options) if options[:myci]\n      end\n    end\n=== Adding custom reporters\nMinitest uses composite reporter to output test results using multiple\nreporter instances. You can add new reporters to the composite during\nthe init_plugins phase. As we saw in +plugin_bogus_init+ above, you\nsimply add your reporter instance to the composite via <tt><<</tt>.\n+AbstractReporter+ defines the API for reporters. You may subclass it\nand override any method you want to achieve your desired behavior.\nstart   :: Called when the run has started.\nrecord  :: Called for each result, passed or otherwise.\nreport  :: Called at the end of the run.\npassed? :: Called to see if you detected any problems.\nUsing our example above, here is how we might implement MyCI:\n    # minitest/bogus_plugin.rb\n    module Minitest\n      class MyCI < AbstractReporter\n        attr_accessor :results, :addr, :port\n        def initialize options\n          self.results = []\n          self.addr = options[:myci_addr]\n          self.port = options[:myci_port]\n        end\n        def record result\n          self.results << result\n        end\n        def report\n          CI.connect(addr, port).send_results self.results\n        end\n      end\n      # code from above...\n    end\n== FAQ\n=== What versions are compatible with what? Or what versions are supported?\nMinitest is a dependency of rails, which until fairly recently had an\noverzealous backwards compatibility policy. As such, I'm stuck\nsupporting versions of ruby that are long past EOL. Once rails 5.2 is\ndropped (hopefully April 2021), I get to drop a bunch of versions of\nruby that I have to currently test against.\n(As of 2021-01-31)\nCurrent versions of rails: (https://endoflife.date/rails)\n  | rails | min ruby | rec ruby | minitest | status   |\n  |-------+----------+----------+----------+----------|\n  |   7.0 | >= 2.7   |      3.0 | >= 5.1   | Future   |\n  |   6.1 | >= 2.5   |      3.0 | >= 5.1   | Current  |\n  |   6.0 | >= 2.5   |      2.6 | >= 5.1   | Security |\n  |   5.2 | >= 2.2.2 |      2.5 | ~> 5.1   | Security | EOL @railsconf 2021?\nCurrent versions of ruby: (https://endoflife.date/ruby)\n  | ruby | Status  |   EOL Date |\n  |------+---------+------------|\n  |  3.0 | Current | 2024-03-31 |\n  |  2.7 | Maint   | 2023-03-31 |\n  |  2.6 | Maint*  | 2022-03-31 |\n  |  2.5 | EOL     | 2021-03-31 |\n  |  2.4 | EOL     | 2020-03-31 |\n  |  2.3 | EOL     | 2019-03-31 |\n  |  2.2 | EOL     | 2018-03-31 |\nSee also:\n* https://www.fastruby.io/blog/ruby/rails/versions/compatibility-table.html\n* https://jamesjeffersconsulting.com/ruby-rails-version-matrix/\n=== How to test SimpleDelegates?\nThe following implementation and test:\n    class Worker < SimpleDelegator\n      def work\n      end\n    end\n    describe Worker do\n      before do\n        @worker = Worker.new(Object.new)\n      end\n      it \"must respond to work\" do\n        _(@worker).must_respond_to :work\n      end\n    end\noutputs a failure:\n      1) Failure:\n    Worker#test_0001_must respond to work [bug11.rb:16]:\n    Expected #<Object:0x007f9e7184f0a0> (Object) to respond to #work.\nWorker is a SimpleDelegate which in 1.9+ is a subclass of BasicObject.\nExpectations are put on Object (one level down) so the Worker\n(SimpleDelegate) hits +method_missing+ and delegates down to the\n+Object.new+ instance. That object doesn't respond to work so the test\nfails.\nYou can bypass <tt>SimpleDelegate#method_missing</tt> by extending the worker\nwith <tt>Minitest::Expectations</tt>. You can either do that in your setup at\nthe instance level, like:\n    before do\n      @worker = Worker.new(Object.new)\n      @worker.extend Minitest::Expectations\n    end\nor you can extend the Worker class (within the test file!), like:\n    class Worker\n      include ::Minitest::Expectations\n    end\n=== How to share code across test classes?\nUse a module. That's exactly what they're for:\n    module UsefulStuff\n      def useful_method\n        # ...\n      end\n    end\n    describe Blah do\n      include UsefulStuff\n      def test_whatever\n        # useful_method available here\n      end\n    end\nRemember, +describe+ simply creates test classes. It's just ruby at\nthe end of the day and all your normal Good Ruby Rules (tm) apply. If\nyou want to extend your test using setup/teardown via a module, just\nmake sure you ALWAYS call super. before/after automatically call super\nfor you, so make sure you don't do it twice.\n=== How to run code before a group of tests?\nUse a constant with begin...end like this:\n  describe Blah do\n    SETUP = begin\n       # ... this runs once when describe Blah starts\n    end\n    # ...\n  end\nThis can be useful for expensive initializations or sharing state.\nRemember, this is just ruby code, so you need to make sure this\ntechnique and sharing state doesn't interfere with your tests.\n=== Why am I seeing <tt>uninitialized constant MiniTest::Test (NameError)</tt>?\nAre you running the test with Bundler (e.g. via <tt>bundle exec</tt> )? If so,\nin order to require minitest, you must first add the <tt>gem 'minitest'</tt>\nto your Gemfile and run +bundle+. Once it's installed, you should be\nable to require minitest and run your tests.\n== Prominent Projects using Minitest:\n* arel\n* journey\n* mime-types\n* nokogiri\n* rails (active_support et al)\n* rake\n* rdoc\n* ...and of course, everything from seattle.rb...\n== Developing Minitest:\nMinitest requires {Hoe}[https://rubygems.org/gems/hoe].\n=== Minitest's own tests require UTF-8 external encoding.\nThis is a common problem in Windows, where the default external Encoding is\noften CP850, but can affect any platform.\nMinitest can run test suites using any Encoding, but to run Minitest's\nown tests you must have a default external Encoding of UTF-8.\nIf your encoding is wrong, you'll see errors like:\n    --- expected\n    +++ actual\n    @@ -1,2 +1,3 @@\n     # encoding: UTF-8\n     -\"Expected /\\\\w+/ to not match \\\"blah blah blah\\\".\"\n     +\"Expected /\\\\w+/ to not match # encoding: UTF-8\n     +\\\"blah blah blah\\\".\"\nTo check your current encoding, run:\n    ruby -e 'puts Encoding.default_external'\nIf your output is something other than UTF-8, you can set the RUBYOPTS\nenv variable to a value of '-Eutf-8'. Something like:\n    RUBYOPT='-Eutf-8' ruby -e 'puts Encoding.default_external'\nCheck your OS/shell documentation for the precise syntax (the above\nwill not work on a basic Windows CMD prompt, look for the SET command).\nOnce you've got it successfully outputing UTF-8, use the same setting\nwhen running rake in Minitest.\n=== Minitest's own tests require GNU (or similar) diff.\nThis is also a problem primarily affecting Windows developers. PowerShell\nhas a command called diff, but it is not suitable for use with Minitest.\nIf you see failures like either of these, you are probably missing diff tool:\n      4) Failure:\n    TestMinitestUnitTestCase#test_assert_equal_different_long [D:/ruby/seattlerb/minitest/test/minitest/test_minitest_test.rb:936]:\n    Expected: \"--- expected\\n+++ actual\\n@@ -1 +1 @@\\n-\\\"hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha\\\"\\n+\\\"blahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblah\\\"\\n\"\n      Actual: \"Expected: \\\"hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha\\\"\\n  Actual: \\\"blahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblah\\\"\"\n      5) Failure:\n    TestMinitestUnitTestCase#test_assert_equal_different_collection_hash_hex_invisible [D:/ruby/seattlerb/minitest/test/minitest/test_minitest_test.rb:845]:\n    Expected: \"No visible difference in the Hash#inspect output.\\nYou should look at the implementation of #== on Hash or its members.\\n\n    {1=>#<Object:0xXXXXXX>}\"\n      Actual: \"Expected: {1=>#<Object:0x00000003ba0470>}\\n  Actual: {1=>#<Object:0x00000003ba0448>}\"\nIf you use Cygwin or MSYS2 or similar there are packages that include a\nGNU diff for Windows.

No magic is involved. I hope.\n== INSTALL:\n  sudo gem install minitest\nOn 1.9, you already have it. To get newer candy you can still install\nthe gem, and then requiring \"minitest/autorun\" should automatically\npull it in. If not, you'll need to do it yourself:\n  gem \"minitest\"     # ensures you\"re using the gem, and not the built-in MT\n  require \"minitest/autorun\"\n  # ... usual testing stuffs ...\nDO NOTE: There is a serious problem with the way that ruby 1.9/2.0\npackages their own gems. They install a gem specification file, but\ndon't install the gem contents in the gem path. This messes up\nGem.find_files and many other things (gem which, gem contents, etc).\nJust install minitest as a gem for real and you'll be happier.\n== LICENSE:\n(The MIT License)\nCopyright (c) Ryan Davis, seattle.rb\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.","notice":""},{"name":"msgpack","version":"1.3.3","licenses":["Apache 2.0"],"texts":"\n                                 Apache License\n                           Version 2.0, January 2004\n                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION\n   1.

Also supports other\nmethods besides `POST`.\n[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/socketry/multipart-post.svg)](http://travis-ci.org/socketry/multipart-post)\n## Features/Problems\n* Appears to actually work. A good feature to have.\n* Encapsulates posting of file/binary parts and name/value parameter parts, similar to\n  most browsers' file upload forms.\n* Provides an `UploadIO` helper class to prepare IO objects for inclusion in the params\n  hash of the multipart post object.\n## Installation\n    gem install multipart-post\nor in your Gemfile\n    gem 'multipart-post'\n## Usage\n```ruby\nrequire 'net/http/post/multipart'\nurl = URI.parse('http://www.example.com/upload')\nFile.open(\"./image.jpg\") do |jpg|\n  req = Net::HTTP::Post::Multipart.new url.path,\n    \"file\" => UploadIO.new(jpg, \"image/jpeg\", \"image.jpg\")\n  res = Net::HTTP.start(url.host, url.port) do |http|\n    http.request(req)\n  end\nend\n```\nTo post multiple files or attachments, simply include multiple parameters with\n`UploadIO` values:\n```ruby\nrequire 'net/http/post/multipart'\nurl = URI.parse('http://www.example.com/upload')\nreq = Net::HTTP::Post::Multipart.new url.path,\n  \"file1\" => UploadIO.new(File.new(\"./image.jpg\"), \"image/jpeg\", \"image.jpg\"),\n  \"file2\" => UploadIO.new(File.new(\"./image2.jpg\"), \"image/jpeg\", \"image2.jpg\")\nres = Net::HTTP.start(url.host, url.port) do |http|\n  http.request(req)\nend\n```\nTo post files with other normal, non-file params such as input values, you need to pass hashes to the `Multipart.new` method.\nIn Rails 4 for example:\n```ruby\ndef model_params\n  require_params = params.require(:model).permit(:param_one, :param_two, :param_three, :avatar)\n  require_params[:avatar] = model_params[:avatar].present? ? UploadIO.new(model_params[:avatar].tempfile, model_params[:avatar].content_type, model_params[:avatar].original_filename) : nil\n  require_params\nend\nrequire 'net/http/post/multipart'\nurl = URI.parse('http://www.example.com/upload')\nNet::HTTP.start(url.host, url.port) do |http|\n  req = Net::HTTP::Post::Multipart.new(url, model_params)\n  key = \"authorization_key\"\n  req.add_field(\"Authorization\", key) #add to Headers\n  http.use_ssl = (url.scheme == \"https\")\n  http.request(req)\nend\n```\nOr in plain ruby:\n```ruby\ndef params(file)\n  params = { \"description\" => \"A nice picture!\" }\n  params[:datei] = UploadIO.new(file, \"image/jpeg\", \"image.jpg\")\n  params\nend\nurl = URI.parse('http://www.example.com/upload')\nFile.open(\"./image.jpg\") do |file|\n  req = Net::HTTP::Post::Multipart.new(url.path, params(file))\n  res = Net::HTTP.start(url.host, url.port) do |http|\n    return http.request(req).body\n  end\nend\n```\n### Debugging\nYou can debug requests and responses (e.g. status codes) for all requests by adding the following code:\n```ruby\nhttp = Net::HTTP.new(uri.host, uri.port)\nhttp.set_debug_output($stdout)\n```\n## License\nReleased under the MIT license.\nCopyright (c) 2007-2013 Nick Sieger <nick@nicksieger.com>  \nCopyright, 2017, by [Samuel G.

It's not present in default, Javaâ, or native Linuxâ releases.\n## Platform Releases\n### Default platform release (\"ruby\")\nThe default platform release distributes the following dependencies in source form:\n- [libxml2](#libxml2)\n- [libxslt](#libxslt)\n- [libgumbo and nokogumbo](#libgumbo-and-nokogumbo)\nThis distribution can be identified by inspecting the included Gem::Specification, which will have the value \"ruby\" for its \"platform\" attribute.\n### Native Linuxâ platform releases (\"x86_64-linux\" and \"arm64-linux\")\nThe native Linuxâ platform release distributes the following dependencies in source form:\n- [libxml2](#libxml2)\n- [libxslt](#libxslt)\n- [libgumbo and nokogumbo](#libgumbo-and-nokogumbo)\n- [zlib](#zlib)\nThis distribution can be identified by inspecting the included Gem::Specification, which will have a value similar to \"x86_64-linux\" or \"x86-linux\" for its \"platform.cpu\" attribute.\n### Native Darwin (macOSâ) platform releases (\"x86_64-darwin\" and \"arm64-darwin\")\nThe native Darwin platform release distributes the following dependencies in source form:\n- [libxml2](#libxml2)\n- [libxslt](#libxslt)\n- [libgumbo and nokogumbo](#libgumbo-and-nokogumbo)\n- [zlib](#zlib)\n- [libiconv](#libiconv)\nThis distribution can be identified by inspecting the included Gem::Specification, which will have a value similar to \"x86_64-darwin\" or \"arm64-darwin\" for its \"platform.cpu\" attribute. Darwin is also known more familiarly as \"OSX\" or \"macOSâ\" and is the operating system for many Appleâ computers.\n### Native Windowsâ platform releases (\"x86-mingw32\" and \"x64-mingw32\")\nThe native Windowsâ platform release distributes the following dependencies in source form:\n- [libxml2](#libxml2)\n- [libxslt](#libxslt)\n- [libgumbo and nokogumbo](#libgumbo-and-nokogumbo)\n- [zlib](#zlib)\n- [libiconv](#libiconv)\nThis distribution can be identified by inspecting the included Gem::Specification, which will have a value similar to \"x64-mingw32\" or \"x86-mingw32\" for its \"platform.cpu\" attribute.\n### Javaâ (JRuby) platform release (\"java\")\nThe Java platform release distributes the following dependencies as compiled jar files:\n- [isorelax](#isorelax)\n- [jing](#jing)\n- [nekodtd](#nekodtd)\n- [nekohtml](#nekohtml)\n- [xalan](#xalan)\n- [xerces](#xerces)\n- [xml-apis](#xml-apis)\nThis distribution can be identified by inspecting the included Gem::Specification, which will have the value \"java\" for its \"platform.os\" attribute.\n## Appendix: Dependencies' License Texts\nThis section contains a subsection for each potentially-distributed dependency, which includes the name of the license and the license text.\nPlease see previous sections to understand which of these potential dependencies is actually distributed in the gem file you're downloading and using.\n### libgumbo and nokogumbo\nApache 2.0\nhttps://github.com/rubys/nokogumbo/blob/f6a7412/LICENSE.txt\n                                     Apache License\n                               Version 2.0, January 2004\n                            http://www.apache.org/licenses/\n    \n       TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION\n    \n       1.

Limitation of Liability.

Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\n    have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\n    this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\n    if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\n    in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n    \n      To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\n    anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\n    These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if\n    you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.\n    \n      For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\n    or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\n    you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\n    code.  If you link a program with the library, you must provide\n    complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them\n    with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling\n    it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n    \n      Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright\n    the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal\n    permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\n    \n      Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain\n    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\n    library.  If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we\n    want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original\n    version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on\n    the original authors' reputations.\n    \f\n      Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\n    patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free\n    software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect\n    transforming the program into proprietary software.  To prevent this,\n    we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's\n    free use or not licensed at all.\n    \n      Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary\n    GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.  This\n    license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain\n    designated libraries.  This license is quite different from the ordinary\n    one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is\n    the same as in the ordinary license.\n    \n      The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that\n    they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a\n    program and simply using it.  Linking a program with a library, without\n    changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is\n    analogous to running a utility program or application program.  However, in\n    a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a\n    derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License\n    treats it as such.\n    \n      Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General\n    Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software\n    sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.  We\n    concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.\n    \n      However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the\n    users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the\n    libraries themselves.  This Library General Public License is intended to\n    permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while\n    preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free\n    libraries that are incorporated in them.  (We have not seen how to achieve\n    this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards\n    changes in the actual functions of the Library.)  The hope is that this\n    will lead to faster development of free libraries.\n    \n      The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\n    modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\n    \"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The\n    former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only\n    works together with the library.\n    \n      Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary\n    General Public License rather than by this special one.\n    \f\n    \t\t  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n       TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n    \n      0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which\n    contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized\n    party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library\n    General Public License (also called \"this License\").  Each licensee is\n    addressed as \"you\".\n    \n      A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data\n    prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\n    (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\n    \n      The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work\n    which has been distributed under these terms.  A \"work based on the\n    Library\" means either the Library or any derivative work under\n    copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\n    portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\n    straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\n    included without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n    \n      \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\n    making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\n    all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\n    interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation\n    and installation of the library.\n    \n      Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\n    covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\n    running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\n    such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\n    on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\n    writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\n    and what the program that uses the Library does.\n      \n      1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\n    complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\n    you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\n    appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\n    all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\n    warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\n    Library.\n    \n      You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\n    and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\n    fee.\n    \f\n      2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\n    of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\n    distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\n    above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n    \n        a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\n    \n        b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\n        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n    \n        c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\n        charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n    \n        d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\n        table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\n        the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\n        is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\n        in the event an application does not supply such function or\n        table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\n        its purpose remains meaningful.\n    \n        (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\n        a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\n        application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\n        application-supplied function or table used by this function must\n        be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\n        root function must still compute square roots.)\n    \n    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\n    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\n    and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\n    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\n    sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\n    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\n    on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\n    this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\n    entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\n    it.\n    \n    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\n    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\n    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\n    collective works based on the Library.\n    \n    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\n    with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\n    a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\n    the scope of this License.\n    \n      3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\n    License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\n    this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\n    that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\n    instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\n    ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\n    that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\n    these notices.\n    \f\n      Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\n    that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\n    subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\n    \n      This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\n    the Library into a program that is not a library.\n    \n      4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\n    derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\n    under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\n    it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\n    must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\n    medium customarily used for software interchange.\n    \n      If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\n    from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\n    source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\n    distribute the source code, even though third parties are not\n    compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n    \n      5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\n    Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\n    linked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".  Such a\n    work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\n    therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n    \n      However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library\n    creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\n    contains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the\n    library\".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\n    Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\n    \n      When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file\n    that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\n    derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\n    Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\n    linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\n    threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\n    \n      If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\n    structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\n    functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\n    file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\n    work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\n    Library will still fall under Section 6.)\n    \n      Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\n    distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\n    Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\n    whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\n    \f\n      6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or\n    link a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a\n    work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\n    under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\n    modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\n    engineering for debugging such modifications.\n    \n      You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\n    Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\n    this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\n    during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\n    copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\n    directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\n    of these things:\n    \n        a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\n        machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\n        changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\n        Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\n        with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that\n        uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the\n        user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\n        executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\n        that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\n        Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\n        to use the modified definitions.)\n    \n        b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at\n        least three years, to give the same user the materials\n        specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more\n        than the cost of performing this distribution.\n    \n        c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\n        from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\n        specified materials from the same place.\n    \n        d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\n        materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\n    \n      For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the\n    Library\" must include any data and utility programs needed for\n    reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\n    the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally\n    distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\n    components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\n    which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\n    the executable.\n    \n      It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\n    restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\n    accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\n    use both them and the Library together in an executable that you\n    distribute.\n    \f\n      7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\n    Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library\n    facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\n    library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\n    the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\n    permitted, and provided that you do these two things:\n    \n        a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\n        based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\n        facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\n        Sections above.\n    \n        b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\n        that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\n        where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n    \n      8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\n    the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\n    attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\n    distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\n    rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\n    or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\n    terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n    \n      9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\n    signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\n    distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\n    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\n    modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\n    Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\n    all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\n    the Library or works based on it.\n    \n      10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\n    Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\n    original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\n    subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\n    restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\n    You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\n    this License.\n    \f\n      11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\n    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\n    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\n    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\n    excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\n    distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\n    License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\n    may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\n    license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\n    all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\n    the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\n    refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\n    \n    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\n    particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,\n    and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\n    \n    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\n    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\n    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\n    integrity of the free software distribution system which is\n    implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\n    generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\n    through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\n    system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\n    to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\n    impose that choice.\n    \n    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\n    be a consequence of the rest of this License.\n    \n      12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\n    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\n    original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add\n    an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,\n    so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus\n    excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if\n    written in the body of this License.\n    \n      13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\n    versions of the Library General Public License from time to time.\n    Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\n    but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n    \n    Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\n    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\n    \"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\n    conditions either of that version or of any later version published by\n    the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\n    license version number, you may choose any version ever published by\n    the Free Software Foundation.\n    \f\n      14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\n    programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\n    write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\n    copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\n    Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\n    decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\n    of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\n    and reuse of software generally.\n    \n    \t\t\t    NO WARRANTY\n    \n      15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\n    WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\n    EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\n    OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\n    KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\n    IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\n    PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\n    LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\n    THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n    \n      16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\n    WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\n    AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\n    FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\n    CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\n    LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\n    RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\n    FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\n    SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\n    DAMAGES.\n    \n    \t\t     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n    \f\n         Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\n    \n      If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\n    possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\n    everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\n    redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the\n    ordinary General Public License).\n    \n      To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is\n    safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\n    convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the\n    \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n    \n        <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n        Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n    \n        This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\n        modify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public\n        License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\n        version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n    \n        This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n        but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n        MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Octokit.rb wraps the [GitHub API][github-api] in a flat API\nclient that follows Ruby conventions and requires little knowledge of REST.\nMost methods have positional arguments for required input and an options hash\nfor optional parameters, headers, or other options:\n```ruby\nclient = Octokit::Client.new\n# Fetch a README with Accept header for HTML format\nclient.readme 'al3x/sovereign', :accept => 'application/vnd.github.html'\n```\n[wrappers]: http://wynnnetherland.com/journal/what-makes-a-good-api-wrapper\n[github-api]: https://developer.github.com/v3/\n## Quick start\nInstall via Rubygems\n    gem install octokit\n... or add to your Gemfile\n    gem \"octokit\", \"~> 4.0\"\nAccess the library in Ruby:\n    require 'octokit'\n### Making requests\n[API methods][] are available as client instance methods.\n```ruby\n# Provide authentication credentials\nclient = Octokit::Client.new(:login => 'defunkt', :password => 'c0d3b4ssssss!')\n# Set access_token instead of login and password if you use personal access token\n# client = Octokit::Client.new(:access_token => '[personal_access_token]!')\n# Fetch the current user\nclient.user\n```\n### Additional Query Parameters\nWhen passing additional parameters to GET based request use the following syntax:\n```ruby\n # query: { parameter_name: 'value' }\n # Example: Get repository listing by owner in ascending order\n client.repos({}, query: {type: 'owner', sort: 'asc'})\n # Example: Get contents of a repository by ref\n # https://api.github.com/repos/octokit/octokit.rb/contents/path/to/file.rb?ref=some-other-branch\n client.contents('octokit/octokit.rb', path: 'path/to/file.rb', query: {ref: 'some-other-branch'})\n```\n[API methods]: http://octokit.github.io/octokit.rb/method_list.html\n### Consuming resources\nMost methods return a `Resource` object which provides dot notation and `[]`\naccess for fields returned in the API response.\n```ruby\nclient = Octokit::Client.new\n# Fetch a user\nuser = client.user 'jbarnette'\nputs user.name\n# => \"John Barnette\"\nputs user.fields\n# => <Set: {:login, :id, :gravatar_id, :type, :name, :company, :blog, :location, :email, :hireable, :bio, :public_repos, :followers, :following, :created_at, :updated_at, :public_gists}>\nputs user[:company]\n# => \"GitHub\"\nuser.rels[:gists].href\n# => \"https://api.github.com/users/jbarnette/gists\"\n```\n**Note:** URL fields are culled into a separate `.rels` collection for easier\n[Hypermedia](#hypermedia-agent) support.\n### Accessing HTTP responses\nWhile most methods return a `Resource` object or a Boolean, sometimes you may\nneed access to the raw HTTP response headers. You can access the last HTTP\nresponse with `Client#last_response`:\n```ruby\nuser      = client.user 'andrewpthorp'\nresponse  = client.last_response\netag      = response.headers[:etag]\n```\n## Authentication\nOctokit supports the various [authentication methods supported by the GitHub\nAPI][auth]:\n### Basic Authentication\nUsing your GitHub username and password is the easiest way to get started\nmaking authenticated requests:\n```ruby\nclient = Octokit::Client.new(:login => 'defunkt', :password => 'c0d3b4ssssss!')\nuser = client.user\nuser.login\n# => \"defunkt\"\n```\nWhile Basic Authentication allows you to get started quickly, OAuth access\ntokens are the preferred way to authenticate on behalf of users.\n### OAuth access tokens\n[OAuth access tokens][oauth] provide two main benefits over using your username\nand password:\n* **Revokable access**. Access tokens can be revoked, removing access for only\n  that token without having to change your password everywhere.\n* **Limited access**. Access tokens have [access scopes][] which allow for more\n  granular access to API resources. For instance, you can grant a third party\n  access to your gists but not your private repositories.\nTo use an access token with the Octokit client, pass your token in the\n`:access_token` options parameter in lieu of your username and password:\n```ruby\nclient = Octokit::Client.new(:access_token => \"<your 40 char token>\")\nuser = client.user\nuser.login\n# => \"defunkt\"\n```\nYou can [create access tokens through your GitHub Account Settings](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use)\nor with a basic authenticated Octokit client:\n```ruby\nclient = Octokit::Client.new(:login => 'defunkt', :password => 'c0d3b4ssssss!')\nclient.create_authorization(:scopes => [\"user\"], :note => \"Name of token\")\n# => <your new oauth token>\n```\n### Two-Factor Authentication\n[Two-Factor Authentication](https://help.github.com/articles/about-two-factor-authentication) brings added security to the account by requiring more information to login.\nUsing two-factor authentication for API calls is as simple as adding the [required header](http://developer.github.com/v3/auth/#working-with-two-factor-authentication) as an option:\n```ruby\nclient = Octokit::Client.new \\\n  :login    => 'defunkt',\n  :password => 'c0d3b4ssssss!'\nuser = client.user(\"defunkt\", :headers => { \"X-GitHub-OTP\" => \"<your 2FA token>\" })\n```\nAs you can imagine, this gets annoying quick since two-factor auth tokens are very short lived. So it is recommended to create an oauth token for the user to communicate with the API:\n```ruby\nclient = Octokit::Client.new \\\n  :login    => 'defunkt',\n  :password => 'c0d3b4ssssss!'\nclient.create_authorization(:scopes => [\"user\"], :note => \"Name of token\",\n                            :headers => { \"X-GitHub-OTP\" => \"<your 2FA token>\" })\n# => <your new oauth token>\n```\n### Using a .netrc file\nOctokit supports reading credentials from a netrc file (defaulting to\n`~/.netrc`).  Given these lines in your netrc:\n```\nmachine api.github.com\n  login defunkt\n  password c0d3b4ssssss!\n```\nYou can now create a client with those credentials:\n```ruby\nclient = Octokit::Client.new(:netrc => true)\nclient.login\n# => \"defunkt\"\n```\nBut _I want to use OAuth_ you say. Since the GitHub API supports using an OAuth\ntoken as a Basic password, you totally can:\n```\nmachine api.github.com\n  login defunkt\n  password <your 40 char token>\n```\n**Note:** Support for netrc requires adding the [netrc gem][] to your Gemfile\nor `.gemspec`.\n### Application authentication\nOctokit also supports application-only authentication [using OAuth application client\ncredentials][app-creds]. Using application credentials will result in making\nanonymous API calls on behalf of an application in order to take advantage of\nthe higher rate limit.\n```ruby\nclient = Octokit::Client.new \\\n  :client_id     => \"<your 20 char id>\",\n  :client_secret => \"<your 40 char secret>\"\nuser = client.user 'defunkt'\n```\n[auth]: http://developer.github.com/v3/#authentication\n[oauth]: http://developer.github.com/v3/oauth/\n[access scopes]: http://developer.github.com/v3/oauth/#scopes\n[app-creds]: http://developer.github.com/v3/#increasing-the-unauthenticated-rate-limit-for-oauth-applications\n## Default results per_page\nDefault results from the GitHub API are 30, if you wish to add more you must do so during Octokit configuration.\n```ruby\nOctokit::Client.new(access_token: \"<your 40 char token>\", per_page: 100)\n```\n## Pagination\nMany GitHub API resources are [paginated][]. While you may be tempted to start\nadding `:page` parameters to your calls, the API returns links to the next,\nprevious, and last pages for you in the `Link` response header as [Hypermedia\nlink relations](#hypermedia-agent).\n```ruby\nissues = client.issues 'rails/rails'\nissues.concat client.get(client.last_response.rels[:next].href)\n```\n### Auto pagination\nFor smallish resource lists, Octokit provides auto pagination. When this is\nenabled, calls for paginated resources will fetch and concatenate the results\nfrom every page into a single array:\n```ruby\nclient.auto_paginate = true\nissues = client.issues 'rails/rails'\nissues.length\n# => 702\n```\nYou can also enable auto pagination for all Octokit client instances:\n```ruby\nOctokit.configure do |c|\n  c.auto_paginate = true\nend\n```\n**Note:** While Octokit auto pagination will set the page size to the maximum\n`100`, and seek to not overstep your rate limit, you probably want to use a\ncustom pattern for traversing large lists.\n[paginated]: http://developer.github.com/v3/#pagination\n## Working with GitHub Enterprise\nWith a bit of setup, you can also use Octokit with your Github Enterprise instance.\n### Interacting with the GitHub.com APIs in GitHub Enterprise\nTo interact with the \"regular\" GitHub.com APIs in GitHub Enterprise, simply configure the `api_endpoint` to match your hostname. For example:\n``` ruby\nOctokit.configure do |c|\n  c.api_endpoint = \"https://<hostname>/api/v3/\"\nend\nclient = Octokit::Client.new(:access_token => \"<your 40 char token>\")\n```\n### Interacting with the GitHub Enterprise Admin APIs\nThe GitHub Enterprise Admin APIs are under a different client: `EnterpriseAdminClient`. You'll need to have an administrator account in order to use these APIs.\n``` ruby\nadmin_client = Octokit::EnterpriseAdminClient.new(\n  :access_token => \"<your 40 char token>\",\n  :api_endpoint => \"https://<hostname>/api/v3/\"\n)\n# or\nOctokit.configure do |c|\n  c.api_endpoint = \"https://<hostname>/api/v3/\"\n  c.access_token = \"<your 40 char token>\"\nend\nadmin_client = Octokit.enterprise_admin_client.new\n```\n### Interacting with the GitHub Enterprise Management Console APIs\nThe GitHub Enterprise Management Console APIs are also under a separate client: `EnterpriseManagementConsoleClient`. In order to use it, you'll need to provide both your management console password as well as the endpoint to your management console. This is different than the API endpoint provided above.\n``` ruby\nmanagement_console_client = Octokit::EnterpriseManagementConsoleClient.new(\n  :management_console_password => \"secret\",\n  :management_console_endpoint = \"https://hostname:8633\"\n)\n# or\nOctokit.configure do |c|\n  c.management_console_endpoint = \"https://hostname:8633\"\n  c.management_console_password = \"secret\"\nend\nmanagement_console_client = Octokit.enterprise_management_console_client.new\n```\n### SSL Connection Errors\nYou *may* need to disable SSL temporarily while first setting up your GitHub Enterprise install. You can do that with the following configuration:\n``` ruby\nclient.connection_options[:ssl] = { :verify => false }\n```\nDo remember to turn `:verify` back to `true`, as it's important for secure communication.\n## Configuration and defaults\nWhile `Octokit::Client` accepts a range of options when creating a new client\ninstance, Octokit's configuration API allows you to set your configuration\noptions at the module level. This is particularly handy if you're creating a\nnumber of client instances based on some shared defaults. Changing options\naffects new instances only and will not modify existing `Octokit::Client`\ninstances created with previous options.\n### Configuring module defaults\nEvery writable attribute in {Octokit::Configurable} can be set one at a time:\n```ruby\nOctokit.api_endpoint = 'http://api.github.dev'\nOctokit.web_endpoint = 'http://github.dev'\n```\nor in batch:\n```ruby\nOctokit.configure do |c|\n  c.api_endpoint = 'http://api.github.dev'\n  c.web_endpoint = 'http://github.dev'\nend\n```\n### Using ENV variables\nDefault configuration values are specified in {Octokit::Default}. Many\nattributes will look for a default value from the ENV before returning\nOctokit's default.\n```ruby\n# Given $OCTOKIT_API_ENDPOINT is \"http://api.github.dev\"\nclient.api_endpoint\n# => \"http://api.github.dev\"\n```\nDeprecation warnings and API endpoints in development preview warnings are\nprinted to STDOUT by default, these can be disabled by setting the ENV\n`OCTOKIT_SILENT=true`.\n### Timeouts\nBy default, Octokit does not timeout network requests. To set a timeout, pass in Faraday timeout settings to Octokit's `connection_options` setting.\n```ruby\nOctokit.configure do |c|\n  c.api_endpoint = ENV.fetch('GITHUB_API_ENDPOINT', 'https://api.github.com/')\n  c.connection_options = {\n    request: {\n      open_timeout: 5,\n      timeout: 5\n    }\n  }\nend\n```\nYou should set a timeout in order to avoid Rubyâs Timeout module, which can hose your server. Here are some resources for more information on this:\n- [The Oldest Bug In Ruby - Why Rack::Timeout Might Hose your Server](https://www.schneems.com/2017/02/21/the-oldest-bug-in-ruby-why-racktimeout-might-hose-your-server/)\n- [Timeout: Ruby's Most Dangerous API](https://www.mikeperham.com/2015/05/08/timeout-rubys-most-dangerous-api/)\n- [The Ultimate Guide to Ruby Timeouts](https://github.com/ankane/the-ultimate-guide-to-ruby-timeouts)\n## Hypermedia agent\nStarting in version 2.0, Octokit is [hypermedia][]-enabled. Under the hood,\n{Octokit::Client} uses [Sawyer][], a hypermedia client built on [Faraday][].\n### Hypermedia in Octokit\nResources returned by Octokit methods contain not only data but hypermedia\nlink relations:\n```ruby\nuser = client.user 'technoweenie'\n# Get the repos rel, returned from the API\n# as repos_url in the resource\nuser.rels[:repos].href\n# => \"https://api.github.com/users/technoweenie/repos\"\nrepos = user.rels[:repos].get.data\nrepos.last.name\n# => \"faraday-zeromq\"\n```\nWhen processing API responses, all `*_url` attributes are culled in to the link\nrelations collection. Any `url` attribute becomes `.rels[:self]`.\n### URI templates\nYou might notice many link relations have variable placeholders. Octokit\nsupports [URI Templates][uri-templates] for parameterized URI expansion:\n```ruby\nrepo = client.repo 'pengwynn/pingwynn'\nrel = repo.rels[:issues]\n# => #<Sawyer::Relation: issues: get https://api.github.com/repos/pengwynn/pingwynn/issues{/number}>\n# Get a page of issues\nrel.get.data\n# Get issue #2\nrel.get(:uri => {:number => 2}).data\n```\n### The Full Hypermedia Experienceâ¢\nIf you want to use Octokit as a pure hypermedia API client, you can start at\nthe API root and follow link relations from there:\n```ruby\nroot = client.root\nroot.rels[:repository].get :uri => {:owner => \"octokit\", :repo => \"octokit.rb\" }\nroot.rels[:user_repositories].get :uri => { :user => \"octokit\" },\n                                  :query => { :type => \"owner\" }\n```\nOctokit 3.0 aims to be hypermedia-driven, removing the internal URL\nconstruction currently used throughout the client.\n[hypermedia]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypermedia\n[Sawyer]: https://github.com/lostisland/sawyer\n[Faraday]: https://github.com/lostisland/faraday\n[uri-templates]: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6570\n## Upgrading guide\nVersion 4.0\n- **removes support for a [long-deprecated overload][list-pulls] for\npassing state as a positional argument** when listing pull requests. Instead,\npass `state` in the method options.\n- **drops support for Ruby < 2.0**.\n- adds support for new [Enterprise-only APIs](#working-with-github-enterprise).\n- adds support for [Repository redirects][redirects].\n[list-pulls]: https://github.com/octokit/octokit.rb/commit/e48e91f736d5fce51e3bf74d7c9022aaa52f5c5c\n[redirects]: https://developer.github.com/changes/2015-05-26-repository-redirects-are-coming/\nVersion 3.0 includes a couple breaking changes when upgrading from v2.x.x:\nThe [default media type][default-media-type] is now `v3` instead of `beta`. If\nyou need to request the older media type, you can set the default media type\nfor the client:\n```ruby\nOctokit.default_media_type = \"application/vnd.github.beta+json\"\n```\nor per-request\n```ruby\nclient.emails(:accept => \"application/vnd.github.beta+json\")\n```\nThe long-deprecated `Octokit::Client#create_download` method has been removed.\n[default-media-type]: https://developer.github.com/changes/2014-01-07-upcoming-change-to-default-media-type/\n### Upgrading from 1.x.x\nVersion 2.0 includes a completely rewritten `Client` factory that now memoizes\nclient instances based on unique configuration options. Breaking changes also\ninclude:\n* `:oauth_token` is now `:access_token`\n* `:auto_traversal` is now `:auto_paginate`\n* `Hashie::Mash` has been removed. Responses now return a `Sawyer::Resource`\n  object. This new type behaves mostly like a Ruby `Hash`, but does not fully\n  support the `Hashie::Mash` API.\n* Two new client error types are raised where appropriate:\n  `Octokit::TooManyRequests` and `Octokit::TooManyLoginAttempts`\n* The `search_*` methods from v1.x are now found at `legacy_search_*`\n* Support for netrc requires including the [netrc gem][] in your Gemfile or\n  gemspec.\n* DateTime fields are now proper `DateTime` objects. Previous versions outputted DateTime fields as 'String' objects.\n[netrc gem]: https://rubygems.org/gems/netrc\n## Advanced usage\nSince Octokit employs [Faraday][faraday] under the hood, some behavior can be\nextended via middleware.\n### Debugging\nOften, it helps to know what Octokit is doing under the hood. You can add a\nlogger to the middleware that enables you to peek into the underlying HTTP\ntraffic:\n```ruby\nstack = Faraday::RackBuilder.new do |builder|\n  builder.use Faraday::Request::Retry, exceptions: [Octokit::ServerError]\n  builder.use Octokit::Middleware::FollowRedirects\n  builder.use Octokit::Response::RaiseError\n  builder.use Octokit::Response::FeedParser\n  builder.response :logger\n  builder.adapter Faraday.default_adapter\nend\nOctokit.middleware = stack\nclient = Octokit::Client.new\nclient.user 'pengwynn'\n```\n```\nI, [2013-08-22T15:54:38.583300 #88227]  INFO -- : get https://api.github.com/users/pengwynn\nD, [2013-08-22T15:54:38.583401 #88227] DEBUG -- request: Accept: \"application/vnd.github.beta+json\"\nUser-Agent: \"Octokit Ruby Gem 2.0.0.rc4\"\nI, [2013-08-22T15:54:38.843313 #88227]  INFO -- Status: 200\nD, [2013-08-22T15:54:38.843459 #88227] DEBUG -- response: server: \"GitHub.com\"\ndate: \"Thu, 22 Aug 2013 20:54:40 GMT\"\ncontent-type: \"application/json; charset=utf-8\"\ntransfer-encoding: \"chunked\"\nconnection: \"close\"\nstatus: \"200 OK\"\nx-ratelimit-limit: \"60\"\nx-ratelimit-remaining: \"39\"\nx-ratelimit-reset: \"1377205443\"\n...\n```\nSee the [Faraday README][faraday] for more middleware magic.\n### Caching\nIf you want to boost performance, stretch your API rate limit, or avoid paying\nthe hypermedia tax, you can use [Faraday Http Cache][cache].\nAdd the gem to your Gemfile\n    gem 'faraday-http-cache'\nNext, construct your own Faraday middleware:\n```ruby\nstack = Faraday::RackBuilder.new do |builder|\n  builder.use Faraday::HttpCache, serializer: Marshal, shared_cache: false\n  builder.use Octokit::Response::RaiseError\n  builder.adapter Faraday.default_adapter\nend\nOctokit.middleware = stack\n```\nOnce configured, the middleware will store responses in cache based on ETag\nfingerprint and serve those back up for future `304` responses for the same\nresource. See the [project README][cache] for advanced usage.\n[cache]: https://github.com/plataformatec/faraday-http-cache\n[faraday]: https://github.com/lostisland/faraday\n## Hacking on Octokit.rb\nIf you want to hack on Octokit locally, we try to make [bootstrapping the\nproject][bootstrapping] as painless as possible. To start hacking, clone and run:\n    script/bootstrap\nThis will install project dependencies and get you up and running. If you want\nto run a Ruby console to poke on Octokit, you can crank one up with:\n    script/console\nUsing the scripts in `./script` instead of `bundle exec rspec`, `bundle\nconsole`, etc.  ensures your dependencies are up-to-date.\n### Code of Conduct\nWe want both the Octokit.rb and larger Octokit communities to be an open\nand welcoming environments. Please read and follow both in spirit and\nletter [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\n### Running and writing new tests\nOctokit uses [VCR][] for recording and playing back API fixtures during test\nruns. These cassettes (fixtures) are part of the Git project in the `spec/cassettes`\nfolder. If you're not recording new cassettes you can run the specs with existing\ncassettes with:\n    script/test\nOctokit uses environmental variables for storing credentials used in testing.\nIf you are testing an API endpoint that doesn't require authentication, you\ncan get away without any additional configuration. For the most part, tests\nuse an authenticated client, using a token stored in `ENV['OCTOKIT_TEST_GITHUB_TOKEN']`.\nThere are several different authenticating method's used across the api.\nHere is the full list of configurable environmental variables for testing\nOctokit:\nENV Variable | Description |\n:-------------------|:-----------------|\n`OCTOKIT_TEST_GITHUB_LOGIN`| GitHub login name (preferably one created specifically for testing against).\n`OCTOKIT_TEST_GITHUB_PASSWORD`| Password for the test GitHub login.\n`OCTOKIT_TEST_GITHUB_TOKEN` | [Personal Access Token](https://github.com/blog/1509-personal-api-tokens) for the test GitHub login.\n`OCTOKIT_TEST_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` | Test OAuth application client id.\n`OCTOKIT_TEST_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` | Test OAuth application client secret.\n`OCTOKIT_TEST_GITHUB_REPOSITORY` | Test repository to perform destructive actions against, this should not be set to any repository of importance. **Automatically created by the test suite if nonexistent** Default: `api-sandbox`\n`OCTOKIT_TEST_GITHUB_ORGANIZATION` | Test organization.\n`OCTOKIT_TEST_GITHUB_ENTERPRISE_LOGIN` | GitHub Enterprise login name.\n`OCTOKIT_TEST_GITHUB_ENTERPRISE_TOKEN` | GitHub Enterprise token.\n`OCTOKIT_TEST_GITHUB_ENTERPRISE_MANAGEMENT_CONSOLE_PASSWORD` | GitHub Enterprise management console password.\n`OCTOKIT_TEST_GITHUB_ENTERPRISE_ENDPOINT` | GitHub Enterprise hostname.\n`OCTOKIT_TEST_GITHUB_ENTERPRISE_MANAGEMENT_CONSOLE_ENDPOINT` | GitHub Enterprise Management Console endpoint.\n`OCTOKIT_TEST_GITHUB_INTEGRATION` | [GitHub Integration](https://developer.github.com/early-access/integrations/) owned by your test organization.\n`OCTOKIT_TEST_GITHUB_INTEGRATION_INSTALLATION` | Installation of the GitHub Integration specified above.\n`OCTOKIT_TEST_INTEGRATION_PEM_KEY` | File path to the private key generated from your integration.\nSince we periodically refresh our cassettes, please keep some points in mind\nwhen writing new specs.\n* **Specs should be idempotent**. The HTTP calls made during a spec should be\n  able to be run over and over. This means deleting a known resource prior to\n  creating it if the name has to be unique.\n* **Specs should be able to be run in random order.** If a spec depends on\n  another resource as a fixture, make sure that's created in the scope of the\n  spec and not depend on a previous spec to create the data needed.\n* **Do not depend on authenticated user info.** Instead of asserting\n  actual values in resources, try to assert the existence of a key or that a\n  response is an Array. We're testing the client, not the API.\n[bootstrapping]: http://wynnnetherland.com/linked/2013012801/bootstrapping-consistency\n[VCR]: https://github.com/vcr/vcr\n## Supported Ruby Versions\nThis library aims to support and is [tested against][actions] the following Ruby\nimplementations:\n* Ruby 2.5\n* Ruby 2.6\n* Ruby 2.7\nIf something doesn't work on one of these Ruby versions, it's a bug.\nThis library may inadvertently work (or seem to work) on other Ruby\nimplementations, but support will only be provided for the versions listed\nabove.\nIf you would like this library to support another Ruby version, you may\nvolunteer to be a maintainer. Being a maintainer entails making sure all tests\nrun and pass on that implementation. When something breaks on your\nimplementation, you will be responsible for providing patches in a timely\nfashion. If critical issues for a particular implementation exist at the time\nof a major release, support for that Ruby version may be dropped.\n[actions]: https://github.com/octokit/octokit.rb/actions\n## Versioning\nThis library aims to adhere to [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0][semver]. Violations\nof this scheme should be reported as bugs. Specifically, if a minor or patch\nversion is released that breaks backward compatibility, that version should be\nimmediately yanked and/or a new version should be immediately released that\nrestores compatibility. Breaking changes to the public API will only be\nintroduced with new major versions. As a result of this policy, you can (and\nshould) specify a dependency on this gem using the [Pessimistic Version\nConstraint][pvc] with two digits of precision. For example:\n    spec.add_dependency 'octokit', '~> 3.0'\nThe changes made between versions can be seen on the [project releases page][releases].\n[semver]: http://semver.org/\n[pvc]: http://guides.rubygems.org/patterns/#pessimistic-version-constraint\n[releases]: https://github.com/octokit/octokit.rb/releases\n## Making Repeating Requests\nIn most cases it would be best to use a [webhooks](https://developer.github.com/webhooks/), but sometimes webhooks don't provide all of the information needed. In those cases where one might need to poll for progress or retry a request on failure, we designed [Octopoller](https://github.com/octokit/octopoller.rb). Octopoller is a micro gem perfect for making repeating requests.\n```ruby\nOctopoller.poll(timeout: 15.seconds) do\n  begin\n    client.request_progress # ex. request a long running job's status\n  rescue Error\n    :re_poll\n  end\nend\n```\nThis is useful when making requests for a long running job's progress (ex. requesting a [Source Import's progress](https://developer.github.com/v3/migrations/source_imports/#get-import-progress)).\n## License\nCopyright (c) 2009-2014 Wynn Netherland, Adam Stacoviak, Erik Michaels-Ober\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n\"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND\nNONINFRINGEMENT.

No need to do `require \"zip/zip\"` and `Zip` prefix in class names removed.\nIf you have issues with any third-party gems that require an old version of rubyzip, you can use this workaround:\n```ruby\ngem 'rubyzip', '>= 1.0.0' # will load new rubyzip version\ngem 'zip-zip' # will load compatibility for old rubyzip API.\n```\n## Requirements\n- Ruby 2.4 or greater (for rubyzip 2.0; use 1.x for older rubies)\n## Installation\nRubyzip is available on RubyGems:\n```\ngem install rubyzip\n```\nOr in your Gemfile:\n```ruby\ngem 'rubyzip'\n```\n## Usage\n### Basic zip archive creation\n```ruby\nrequire 'rubygems'\nrequire 'zip'\nfolder = \"Users/me/Desktop/stuff_to_zip\"\ninput_filenames = ['image.jpg', 'description.txt', 'stats.csv']\nzipfile_name = \"/Users/me/Desktop/archive.zip\"\nZip::File.open(zipfile_name, Zip::File::CREATE) do |zipfile|\n  input_filenames.each do |filename|\n    # Two arguments:\n    # - The name of the file as it will appear in the archive\n    # - The original file, including the path to find it\n    zipfile.add(filename, File.join(folder, filename))\n  end\n  zipfile.get_output_stream(\"myFile\") { |f| f.write \"myFile contains just this\" }\nend\n```\n### Zipping a directory recursively\nCopy from [here](https://github.com/rubyzip/rubyzip/blob/9d891f7353e66052283562d3e252fe380bb4b199/samples/example_recursive.rb)\n```ruby\nrequire 'zip'\n# This is a simple example which uses rubyzip to\n# recursively generate a zip file from the contents of\n# a specified directory. The directory itself is not\n# included in the archive, rather just its contents.\n#\n# Usage:\n#   directory_to_zip = \"/tmp/input\"\n#   output_file = \"/tmp/out.zip\"\n#   zf = ZipFileGenerator.new(directory_to_zip, output_file)\n#   zf.write()\nclass ZipFileGenerator\n  # Initialize with the directory to zip and the location of the output archive.\n  def initialize(input_dir, output_file)\n    @input_dir = input_dir\n    @output_file = output_file\n  end\n  # Zip the input directory.\n  def write\n    entries = Dir.entries(@input_dir) - %w[. ..]\n    ::Zip::File.open(@output_file, ::Zip::File::CREATE) do |zipfile|\n      write_entries entries, '', zipfile\n    end\n  end\n  private\n  # A helper method to make the recursion work.\n  def write_entries(entries, path, zipfile)\n    entries.each do |e|\n      zipfile_path = path == '' ? e : File.join(path, e)\n      disk_file_path = File.join(@input_dir, zipfile_path)\n      if File.directory? disk_file_path\n        recursively_deflate_directory(disk_file_path, zipfile, zipfile_path)\n      else\n        put_into_archive(disk_file_path, zipfile, zipfile_path)\n      end\n    end\n  end\n  def recursively_deflate_directory(disk_file_path, zipfile, zipfile_path)\n    zipfile.mkdir zipfile_path\n    subdir = Dir.entries(disk_file_path) - %w[. ..]\n    write_entries subdir, zipfile_path, zipfile\n  end\n  def put_into_archive(disk_file_path, zipfile, zipfile_path)\n    zipfile.add(zipfile_path, disk_file_path)\n  end\nend\n```\n### Save zip archive entries in sorted by name state\nTo save zip archives in sorted order like below, you need to set `::Zip.sort_entries` to `true`\n```\nVegetable/\nVegetable/bean\nVegetable/carrot\nVegetable/celery\nfruit/\nfruit/apple\nfruit/kiwi\nfruit/mango\nfruit/orange\n```\nAfter this, entries in the zip archive will be saved in ordered state.\n### Default permissions of zip archives\nOn Posix file systems the default file permissions applied to a new archive\nare (0666 - umask), which mimics the behavior of standard tools such as `touch`.\nOn Windows the default file permissions are set to 0644 as suggested by the\n[Ruby File documentation](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.2/File.html).\nWhen modifying a zip archive the file permissions of the archive are preserved.\n### Reading a Zip file\n```ruby\nMAX_SIZE = 1024**2 # 1MiB (but of course you can increase this)\nZip::File.open('foo.zip') do |zip_file|\n  # Handle entries one by one\n  zip_file.each do |entry|\n    puts \"Extracting #{entry.name}\"\n    raise 'File too large when extracted' if entry.size > MAX_SIZE\n    # Extract to file or directory based on name in the archive\n    entry.extract\n    # Read into memory\n    content = entry.get_input_stream.read\n  end\n  # Find specific entry\n  entry = zip_file.glob('*.csv').first\n  raise 'File too large when extracted' if entry.size > MAX_SIZE\n  puts entry.get_input_stream.read\nend\n```\n#### Notice about ::Zip::InputStream\n`::Zip::InputStream` usable for fast reading zip file content because it not read Central directory.\nBut there is one exception when it is not working - General Purpose Flag Bit 3.\n> If bit 3 (0x08) of the general-purpose flags field is set, then the CRC-32 and file sizes are not known when the header is written. The fields in the local header are filled with zero, and the CRC-32 and size are appended in a 12-byte structure (optionally preceded by a 4-byte signature) immediately after the compressed data\nIf `::Zip::InputStream` finds such entry in the zip archive it will raise an exception.\n### Password Protection (Experimental)\nRubyzip supports reading/writing zip files with traditional zip encryption (a.k.a. \"ZipCrypto\"). AES encryption is not yet supported. It can be used with buffer streams, e.g.:\n```ruby\nZip::OutputStream.write_buffer(::StringIO.new(''), Zip::TraditionalEncrypter.new('password')) do |out|\n  out.put_next_entry(\"my_file.txt\")\n  out.write my_data\nend.string\n```\nThis is an experimental feature and the interface for encryption may change in future versions.\n## Known issues\n### Modify docx file with rubyzip\nUse `write_buffer` instead `open`. Thanks to @jondruse\n```ruby\nbuffer = Zip::OutputStream.write_buffer do |out|\n  @zip_file.entries.each do |e|\n    unless [DOCUMENT_FILE_PATH, RELS_FILE_PATH].include?(e.name)\n      out.put_next_entry(e.name)\n      out.write e.get_input_stream.read\n     end\n  end\n  out.put_next_entry(DOCUMENT_FILE_PATH)\n  out.write xml_doc.to_xml(:indent => 0).gsub(\"\\n\",\"\")\n  out.put_next_entry(RELS_FILE_PATH)\n  out.write rels.to_xml(:indent => 0).gsub(\"\\n\",\"\")\nend\nFile.open(new_path, \"wb\") {|f| f.write(buffer.string) }\n```\n## Configuration\n### Existing Files\nBy default, rubyzip will not overwrite files if they already exist inside of the extracted path. To change this behavior, you may specify a configuration option like so:\n```ruby\nZip.on_exists_proc = true\n```\nIf you're using rubyzip with rails, consider placing this snippet of code in an initializer file such as `config/initializers/rubyzip.rb`\nAdditionally, if you want to configure rubyzip to overwrite existing files while creating a .zip file, you can do so with the following:\n```ruby\nZip.continue_on_exists_proc = true\n```\n### Non-ASCII Names\nIf you want to store non-english names and want to open them on Windows(pre 7) you need to set this option:\n```ruby\nZip.unicode_names = true\n```\nSometimes file names inside zip contain non-ASCII characters. If you can assume which encoding was used for such names and want to be able to find such entries using `find_entry` then you can force assumed encoding like so:\n```ruby\nZip.force_entry_names_encoding = 'UTF-8'\n```\nAllowed encoding names are the same as accepted by `String#force_encoding`\n### Date Validation\nSome zip files might have an invalid date format, which will raise a warning. You can hide this warning with the following setting:\n```ruby\nZip.warn_invalid_date = false\n```\n### Size Validation\nBy default (in rubyzip >= 2.0), rubyzip's `extract` method checks that an entry's reported uncompressed size is not (significantly) smaller than its actual size. This is to help you protect your application against [zip bombs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_bomb). Before `extract`ing an entry, you should check that its size is in the range you expect. For example, if your application supports processing up to 100 files at once, each up to 10MiB, your zip extraction code might look like:\n```ruby\nMAX_FILE_SIZE = 10 * 1024**2 # 10MiB\nMAX_FILES = 100\nZip::File.open('foo.zip') do |zip_file|\n  num_files = 0\n  zip_file.each do |entry|\n    num_files += 1 if entry.file?\n    raise 'Too many extracted files' if num_files > MAX_FILES\n    raise 'File too large when extracted' if entry.size > MAX_FILE_SIZE\n    entry.extract\n  end\nend\n```\nIf you need to extract zip files that report incorrect uncompressed sizes and you really trust them not too be too large, you can disable this setting with\n```ruby\nZip.validate_entry_sizes = false\n```\nNote that if you use the lower level `Zip::InputStream` interface, `rubyzip` does *not* check the entry `size`s. In this case, the caller is responsible for making sure it does not read more data than expected from the input stream.\n### Default Compression\nYou can set the default compression level like so:\n```ruby\nZip.default_compression = Zlib::DEFAULT_COMPRESSION\n```\nIt defaults to `Zlib::DEFAULT_COMPRESSION`. Possible values are `Zlib::BEST_COMPRESSION`, `Zlib::DEFAULT_COMPRESSION` and `Zlib::NO_COMPRESSION`\n### Zip64 Support\nBy default, Zip64 support is disabled for writing. To enable it do this:\n```ruby\nZip.write_zip64_support = true\n```\n_NOTE_: If you will enable Zip64 writing then you will need zip extractor with Zip64 support to extract archive.\n### Block Form\nYou can set multiple settings at the same time by using a block:\n```ruby\n  Zip.setup do |c|\n    c.on_exists_proc = true\n    c.continue_on_exists_proc = true\n    c.unicode_names = true\n    c.default_compression = Zlib::BEST_COMPRESSION\n  end\n```\n## Developing\nTo run the test you need to do this:\n```\nbundle install\nrake\n```\n## Website and Project Home\nhttp://github.com/rubyzip/rubyzip\nhttp://rdoc.info/github/rubyzip/rubyzip/master/frames\n## Authors\nAlexander Simonov ( alex at simonov.me)\nAlan Harper ( alan at aussiegeek.net)\nThomas Sondergaard (thomas at sondergaard.cc)\nTechnorama Ltd.

By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\t\t    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\t\t\t    NO WARRANTY\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\t\t     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\t    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Of course, the commands you use may\nbe called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be\nmouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\nnecessary.

It also counts\n as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\n the version number 2.1.]\n                            Preamble\n  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\nfreedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\nfree software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\nspecially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\nFree Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\ncan use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\nthis license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\nstrategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\nnot price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\nyou have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\nfor this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\nit if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\nit in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\nthese things.\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\ndistributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\nrights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\nyou if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\n  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\nor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\nyou.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\ncode.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\ncomplete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\nwith the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\nit.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\nlibrary, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\npermission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\n  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\nthere is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\nmodified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\nthat what they have is not the original version, so that the original\nauthor's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\nintroduced by others.\n\f\n  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\nany free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\neffectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\nrestrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\nany patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\nconsistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\n  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\nordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\nis quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\nthis license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\nlibraries into non-free programs.\n  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\na shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\ncombined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\nGeneral Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\nentire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\nPublic License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\nthe library.\n  We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it\ndoes Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\nPublic License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\nof an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\nare the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\nlibraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\nspecial circumstances.\n  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\nencourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes\na de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be\nallowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\nlibrary does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\ncase, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\nsoftware only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\n  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\nprograms enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\nfree software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\nnon-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\noperating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\nsystem.\n  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\nusers' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\nlinked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\nthat program using a modified version of the Library.\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\n\"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The\nformer contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\nbe combined with the library in order to run.\n\f\n                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\nprogram which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\nother authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\nthis Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\").\nEach licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n  A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data\nprepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\n(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\n  The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work\nwhich has been distributed under these terms.  A \"work based on the\nLibrary\" means either the Library or any derivative work under\ncopyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\nportion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\nstraightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\nincluded without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n  \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\nall the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\ninterface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation\nand installation of the library.\n  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\nsuch a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\non the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\nwriting it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\nand what the program that uses the Library does.\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\ncomplete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\nyou conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\nappropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\nall the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\nwarranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\nLibrary.\n  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\nand you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\nfee.\n\f\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\n    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\n    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\n    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\n    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\n    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\n    in the event an application does not supply such function or\n    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\n    its purpose remains meaningful.\n    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\n    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\n    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\n    application-supplied function or table used by this function must\n    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\n    root function must still compute square roots.)\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\nit.\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Library.\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\nwith the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\nLicense instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\nthis, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\nthat they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\ninstead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\nordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\nthat version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\nthese notices.\n\f\n  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\nthat copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\nsubsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\n  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\nthe Library into a program that is not a library.\n  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\nderivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\nunder the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\nit with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\nmust be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\nmedium customarily used for software interchange.\n  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\nfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\nsource code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\ndistribute the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\nLibrary, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\nlinked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".  Such a\nwork, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\ntherefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n  However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library\ncreates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\ncontains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the\nlibrary\".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\nSection 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\n  When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file\nthat is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\nderivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\nWhether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\nlinked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\nthreshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\n  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\nstructure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\nfunctions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\nfile is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\nwork.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\nLibrary will still fall under Section 6.)\n  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\ndistribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\nAny executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\nwhether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\n\f\n  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\nlink a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a\nwork containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\nunder terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\nmodification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications.\n  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\nLibrary is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\nthis License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\nduring execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\ncopyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\ndirecting the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\nof these things:\n    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\n    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\n    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\n    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\n    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that\n    uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the\n    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\n    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\n    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\n    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\n    to use the modified definitions.)\n    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\n    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\n    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\n    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\n    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\n    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\n    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at\n    least three years, to give the same user the materials\n    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more\n    than the cost of performing this distribution.\n    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\n    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\n    specified materials from the same place.\n    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\n    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\n  For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the\nLibrary\" must include any data and utility programs needed for\nreproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\nthe materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\nnormally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\ncomponents (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\nwhich the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\nthe executable.\n  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\nrestrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\naccompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\nuse both them and the Library together in an executable that you\ndistribute.\n\f\n  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side-by-side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\nlibrary, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\nthe Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\npermitted, and provided that you do these two things:\n    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\n    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\n    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\n    Sections above.\n    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\n    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\n    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\nthe Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\nattempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\ndistribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\nrights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\nor rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\nterminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Library or works based on it.\n  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\nsubject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\nthis License.\n\f\n  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\nparticular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,\nand the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add\nan explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,\nso that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus\nexcluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if\nwritten in the body of this License.\n  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\nversions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\nSuch new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\nbut may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\n\"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that version or of any later version published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\nlicense version number, you may choose any version ever published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.\n\f\n  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\nwrite to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\ncopyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\nSoftware Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\ndecision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\nof all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\nand reuse of software generally.\n                            NO WARRANTY\n  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\nWARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\nEXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\nOTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\nKIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\nLIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\nTHE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\nWRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\nAND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\nFOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\nCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\nLIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\nRENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\nFAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\nSUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\nDAMAGES.\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\f\n           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\n  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\neveryone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\nredistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the\nordinary General Public License).\n  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is\nsafest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the\n\"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\n    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\n    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\n    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\t\t    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\t\t\t    NO WARRANTY\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\t\t     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\t    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software\n    Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this\nwhen it starts in an interactive mode:\n    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author\n    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may\nbe called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be\nmouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\nnecessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\n  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program\n  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\n  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989\n  Ty Coon, President of Vice\nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\nproprietary programs.

It also counts\n as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\n the version number 2.1.]\n                            Preamble\n  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\nfreedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\nfree software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\nspecially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\nFree Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\ncan use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\nthis license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\nstrategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\nnot price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\nyou have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\nfor this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\nit if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\nit in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\nthese things.\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\ndistributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\nrights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\nyou if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\n  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\nor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\nyou.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\ncode.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\ncomplete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\nwith the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\nit.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\nlibrary, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\npermission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\n  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\nthere is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\nmodified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\nthat what they have is not the original version, so that the original\nauthor's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\nintroduced by others.\n\f\n  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\nany free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\neffectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\nrestrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\nany patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\nconsistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\n  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\nordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\nis quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\nthis license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\nlibraries into non-free programs.\n  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\na shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\ncombined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\nGeneral Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\nentire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\nPublic License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\nthe library.\n  We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it\ndoes Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\nPublic License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\nof an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\nare the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\nlibraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\nspecial circumstances.\n  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\nencourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes\na de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be\nallowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\nlibrary does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\ncase, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\nsoftware only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\n  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\nprograms enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\nfree software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\nnon-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\noperating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\nsystem.\n  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\nusers' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\nlinked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\nthat program using a modified version of the Library.\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\n\"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The\nformer contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\nbe combined with the library in order to run.\n\f\n                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\nprogram which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\nother authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\nthis Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\").\nEach licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n  A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data\nprepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\n(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\n  The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work\nwhich has been distributed under these terms.  A \"work based on the\nLibrary\" means either the Library or any derivative work under\ncopyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\nportion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\nstraightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\nincluded without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n  \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\nall the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\ninterface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation\nand installation of the library.\n  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\nsuch a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\non the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\nwriting it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\nand what the program that uses the Library does.\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\ncomplete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\nyou conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\nappropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\nall the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\nwarranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\nLibrary.\n  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\nand you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\nfee.\n\f\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\n    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\n    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\n    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\n    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\n    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\n    in the event an application does not supply such function or\n    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\n    its purpose remains meaningful.\n    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\n    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\n    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\n    application-supplied function or table used by this function must\n    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\n    root function must still compute square roots.)\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\nit.\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Library.\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\nwith the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\nLicense instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\nthis, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\nthat they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\ninstead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\nordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\nthat version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\nthese notices.\n\f\n  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\nthat copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\nsubsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\n  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\nthe Library into a program that is not a library.\n  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\nderivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\nunder the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\nit with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\nmust be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\nmedium customarily used for software interchange.\n  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\nfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\nsource code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\ndistribute the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\nLibrary, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\nlinked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".  Such a\nwork, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\ntherefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n  However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library\ncreates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\ncontains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the\nlibrary\".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\nSection 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\n  When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file\nthat is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\nderivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\nWhether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\nlinked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\nthreshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\n  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\nstructure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\nfunctions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\nfile is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\nwork.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\nLibrary will still fall under Section 6.)\n  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\ndistribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\nAny executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\nwhether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\n\f\n  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\nlink a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a\nwork containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\nunder terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\nmodification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications.\n  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\nLibrary is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\nthis License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\nduring execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\ncopyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\ndirecting the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\nof these things:\n    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\n    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\n    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\n    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\n    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that\n    uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the\n    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\n    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\n    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\n    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\n    to use the modified definitions.)\n    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\n    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\n    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\n    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\n    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\n    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\n    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at\n    least three years, to give the same user the materials\n    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more\n    than the cost of performing this distribution.\n    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\n    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\n    specified materials from the same place.\n    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\n    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\n  For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the\nLibrary\" must include any data and utility programs needed for\nreproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\nthe materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\nnormally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\ncomponents (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\nwhich the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\nthe executable.\n  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\nrestrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\naccompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\nuse both them and the Library together in an executable that you\ndistribute.\n\f\n  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side-by-side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\nlibrary, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\nthe Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\npermitted, and provided that you do these two things:\n    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\n    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\n    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\n    Sections above.\n    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\n    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\n    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\nthe Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\nattempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\ndistribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\nrights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\nor rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\nterminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Library or works based on it.\n  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\nsubject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\nthis License.\n\f\n  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\nparticular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,\nand the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add\nan explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,\nso that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus\nexcluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if\nwritten in the body of this License.\n  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\nversions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\nSuch new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\nbut may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\n\"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that version or of any later version published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\nlicense version number, you may choose any version ever published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.\n\f\n  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\nwrite to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\ncopyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\nSoftware Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\ndecision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\nof all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\nand reuse of software generally.\n                            NO WARRANTY\n  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\nWARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\nEXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\nOTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\nKIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\nLIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\nTHE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\nWRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\nAND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\nFOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\nCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\nLIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\nRENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\nFAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\nSUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\nDAMAGES.\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\f\n           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\n  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\neveryone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\nredistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the\nordinary General Public License).\n  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is\nsafest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the\n\"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\n    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\n    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\n    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

There are two options:\n1. A zoneinfo directory containing timezone definition files. These files are\n   generated from the [IANA Time Zone Database](https://www.iana.org/time-zones)\n   using the `zic` utility. Most Unix-like systems include a zoneinfo directory.\n2. The TZInfo::Data library (the tzinfo-data gem). TZInfo::Data contains a set\n   of Ruby modules that are also generated from the IANA Time Zone Database.\nBy default, TZInfo will attempt to use TZInfo::Data. If TZInfo::Data is not\navailable (i.e. if `require 'tzinfo/data'` fails), then TZInfo will search for a\nzoneinfo directory instead (using the search path specified by\n`TZInfo::ZoneinfoDataSource::DEFAULT_SEARCH_PATH`).\nIf no data source can be found, a `TZInfo::DataSourceNotFound` exception will be\nraised when TZInfo is used. Further information is available\n[in the wiki](https://tzinfo.github.io/datasourcenotfound) to help resolve\n`TZInfo::DataSourceNotFound` errors.\nThe default data source selection can be overridden by calling\n`TZInfo::DataSource.set`.\nCustom data sources can also be used. See the `TZInfo::DataSource.set`\ndocumentation for further details.\n## Installation\nThe TZInfo gem can be installed by running `gem install tzinfo` or by adding\n`gem 'tzinfo'` to your `Gemfile` and running `bundle install`.\nTo use the Ruby modules as the data source, TZInfo::Data will also need to be\ninstalled by running `gem install tzinfo-data` or by adding `gem 'tzinfo-data'`\nto your `Gemfile`.\n## IANA Time Zone Database\nThe data returned and used by TZInfo is sourced from the\n[IANA Time Zone Database](http://www.iana.org/time-zones). The\n[Theory and pragmatics of the tz code and data](https://data.iana.org/time-zones/theory.html)\ndocument gives details of how the data is organized and managed.\n## Example Usage\nTo use TZInfo, it must first be required with:\n```ruby\nrequire 'tzinfo'\n```\nThe `TZInfo::Timezone` class provides access to time zone data and methods for\nconverting times.\nThe `all_identifiers` method returns a list of valid time zone identifiers:\n```ruby\nidentifiers = TZInfo::Timezone.all_identifiers\n# => [\"Africa/Adibdjan\", \"Africa/Accra\", ..., \"Zulu\"]\n```\nA `TZInfo::Timezone` instance representing an individual time zone can be\nobtained with `TZInfo::Timezone.get`:\n```ruby\ntz = TZInfo::Timezone.get('America/New_York')\n# => #<TZInfo::DataTimezone: America/New_York>\n```\nA time can be converted to the local time of the time zone with `to_local`:\n```ruby\ntz.to_local(Time.utc(2018, 2, 1, 12, 30, 0))\n# => 2018-02-01 07:30:00 -0500\ntz.to_local(Time.utc(2018, 7, 1, 12, 30, 0))\n# => 2018-07-01 08:30:00 -0400\ntz.to_local(Time.new(2018, 7, 1, 13, 30, 0, '+01:00'))\n# => 2018-07-01 08:30:00 -0400\n```\nLocal times with the appropriate offset for the time zone can be constructed\nwith `local_time`:\n```ruby\ntz.local_time(2018, 2, 1, 7, 30, 0)\n# => 2018-02-01 07:30:00 -0500\ntz.local_time(2018, 7, 1, 8, 30, 0)\n# => 2018-07-01 08:30:00 -0400\n```\nLocal times can be converted to UTC by using `local_time` and calling `utc` on\nthe result:\n```ruby\ntz.local_time(2018, 2, 1, 7, 30, 0).utc\n# => 2018-02-01 12:30:00 UTC\ntz.local_time(2018, 7, 1, 8, 30, 0).utc\n# => 2018-07-01 12:30:00 UTC\n```\nThe `local_to_utc` method can also be used to convert a time object to UTC. The\noffset of the time is ignored - it is treated as if it were a local time for the\ntime zone:\n```ruby\ntz.local_to_utc(Time.utc(2018, 2, 1, 7, 30, 0))\n# => 2018-02-01 12:30:00 UTC\ntz.local_to_utc(Time.new(2018, 2, 1, 7, 30, 0, '+01:00'))\n# => 2018-02-01 12:30:00 UTC\n```\nInformation about the time zone can be obtained from returned local times:\n```ruby\nlocal_time = tz.to_local(Time.utc(2018, 2, 1, 12, 30, 0))\nlocal_time.utc_offset  # => -18000\nlocal_time.dst?        # => false\nlocal_time.zone        # => \"EST\"\nlocal_time = tz.to_local(Time.utc(2018, 7, 1, 12, 30, 0))\nlocal_time.utc_offset  # => -14400\nlocal_time.dst?        # => true\nlocal_time.zone        # => \"EDT\"\n```\nTime zone information can be included when formatting times with `strftime`\nusing the `%z` and `%Z` directives:\n```ruby\ntz.to_local(Time.utc(2018, 2, 1, 12, 30, 0)).strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %z %Z')\n# => \"2018-02-01 07:30:00 -0500 EST\"\ntz.to_local(Time.utc(2018, 7, 1, 12, 30, 0)).strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %z %Z')\n# => \"2018-07-01 08:30:00 -0400 EDT\"\n```\nThe `period_for` method can be used to obtain information about the observed\ntime zone information at a particular time as a `TZInfo::TimezonePeriod` object:\n```ruby\nperiod = tz.period_for(Time.utc(2018, 7, 1, 12, 30, 0))\nperiod.base_utc_offset          # => -18000\nperiod.std_offset               # => 3600\nperiod.observed_utc_offset      # => -14400\nperiod.abbreviation             # => \"EDT\"\nperiod.dst?                     # => true\nperiod.local_starts_at.to_time  # => 2018-03-11 03:00:00 -0400\nperiod.local_ends_at.to_time    # => 2018-11-04 02:00:00 -0400\n```\nA list of transitions between periods where different rules are observed can be\nobtained with the `transitions_up_to` method. The result is returned as an\n`Array` of `TZInfo::TimezoneTransition` objects:\n```ruby\ntransitions = tz.transitions_up_to(Time.utc(2019, 1, 1), Time.utc(2017, 1, 1))\ntransitions.map do |t|\n  [t.local_end_at.to_time, t.offset.observed_utc_offset, t.offset.abbreviation]\nend\n# => [[2017-03-12 02:00:00 -0500, -14400, \"EDT\"],\n#     [2017-11-05 02:00:00 -0400, -18000, \"EST\"],\n#     [2018-03-11 02:00:00 -0500, -14400, \"EDT\"],\n#     [2018-11-04 02:00:00 -0400, -18000, \"EST\"]]\n```\nA list of the unique offsets used by a time zone can be obtained with the\n`offsets_up_to` method. The result is returned as an `Array` of\n`TZInfo::TimezoneOffset` objects:\n```ruby\noffsets = tz.offsets_up_to(Time.utc(2019, 1, 1))\noffsets.map {|o| [o.observed_utc_offset, o.abbreviation] }\n# => [[-17762, \"LMT\"],\n#     [-18000, \"EST\"],\n#     [-14400, \"EDT\"],\n#     [-14400, \"EWT\"],\n#     [-14400, \"EPT\"]]\n```\nAll `TZInfo::Timezone` methods that accept a time as a parameter can be used\nwith either instances of `Time`, `DateTime` or `TZInfo::Timestamp`. Arbitrary\n`Time`-like objects that respond to both `to_i` and `subsec` and optionally\n`utc_offset` will be treated as if they are instances of `Time`.\n`TZInfo::Timezone` methods that both accept and return times will return an\nobject with a type matching that of the parameter (actually a\n`TZInfo::TimeWithOffset`, `TZInfo::DateTimeWithOffset` or\n`TZInfo::TimestampWithOffset` subclass when returning a local time):\n```ruby\ntz.to_local(Time.utc(2018, 7, 1, 12, 30, 0))\n# => 2018-07-01 08:30:00 -0400\ntz.to_local(DateTime.new(2018, 7, 1, 12, 30, 0))\n# => #<TZInfo::DateTimeWithOffset: 2018-07-01T08:30:00-04:00 ((2458301j,45000s,0n),-14400s,2299161j)>\ntz.to_local(TZInfo::Timestamp.create(2018, 7, 1, 12, 30, 0, 0, :utc))\n# => #<TZInfo::TimestampWithOffset: @value=1530448200, @sub_second=0, @utc_offset=-14400, @utc=false>\n```\nIn addition to `local_time`, which returns `Time` instances, the\n`local_datetime` and `local_timestamp` methods can be used to construct local\n`DateTime` and `TZInfo::Timestamp` instances with the appropriate offset:\n```ruby\ntz.local_time(2018, 2, 1, 7, 30, 0)\n# => 2018-02-01 07:30:00 -0500\ntz.local_datetime(2018, 2, 1, 7, 30, 0)\n# => #<TZInfo::DateTimeWithOffset: 2018-02-01T07:30:00-05:00 ((2458151j,45000s,0n),-18000s,2299161j)>\ntz.local_timestamp(2018, 2, 1, 7, 30, 0)\n# => #<TZInfo::TimestampWithOffset: @value=1517488200, @sub_second=0, @utc_offset=-18000, @utc=false>\n```\nThe `local_to_utc`, `local_time`, `local_datetime` and `local_timestamp` methods\nmay raise a `TZInfo::PeriodNotFound` or a `TZInfo::AmbiguousTime` exception.\n`TZInfo::PeriodNotFound` signals that there is no equivalent UTC time (for\nexample, during the transition from standard time to daylight savings time when\nthe clocks are moved forward and an hour is skipped). `TZInfo::AmbiguousTime`\nsignals that there is more than one equivalent UTC time (for example, during the\ntransition from daylight savings time to standard time where the clocks are\nmoved back and an hour is repeated):\n```ruby\ntz.local_time(2018, 3, 11, 2, 30, 0, 0)\n# raises TZInfo::PeriodNotFound (2018-03-11 02:30:00 is an invalid local time.)\ntz.local_time(2018, 11, 4, 1, 30, 0, 0)\n# raises TZInfo::AmbiguousTime (2018-11-04 01:30:00 is an ambiguous local time.)\n```\n`TZInfo::PeriodNotFound` exceptions can only be resolved by adjusting the time,\nfor example, by advancing an hour:\n```ruby\ntz.local_time(2018, 3, 11, 3, 30, 0, 0)\n# => 2018-03-11 03:30:00 -0400\n```\n`TZInfo::AmbiguousTime` exceptions can be resolved by setting the `dst`\nparameter and/or specifying a block to choose one of the interpretations:\n```ruby\ntz.local_time(2018, 11, 4, 1, 30, 0, 0, true)\n# => 2018-11-04 01:30:00 -0400\ntz.local_time(2018, 11, 4, 1, 30, 0, 0, false)\n# => 2018-11-04 01:30:00 -0500\ntz.local_time(2018, 11, 4, 1, 30, 0, 0) {|p| p.first }\n# => 2018-11-04 01:30:00 -0400\ntz.local_time(2018, 11, 4, 1, 30, 0, 0) {|p| p.last }\n# => 2018-11-04 01:30:00 -0500\n```\nThe default value of the `dst` parameter can also be set globally:\n```ruby\nTZInfo::Timezone.default_dst = true\ntz.local_time(2018, 11, 4, 1, 30, 0, 0)\n# => 2018-11-04 01:30:00 -0400\nTZInfo::Timezone.default_dst = false\ntz.local_time(2018, 11, 4, 1, 30, 0, 0)\n# => 2018-11-04 01:30:00 -0500\n```\nTZInfo also provides information about\n[ISO 3166-1](https://www.iso.org/iso-3166-country-codes.html) countries and\ntheir associated time zones via the `TZInfo::Country` class.\nA list of valid ISO 3166-1 (alpha-2) country codes can be obtained by calling\n`TZInfo::Country.all_codes`:\n```ruby\nTZInfo::Country.all_codes\n# => [\"AD\", \"AE\", ..., \"ZW\"]\n```\nA `TZInfo::Country` instance representing an individual time zone can be\nobtained with `TZInfo::Country.get`:\n```ruby\nc = TZInfo::Country.get('US')\n# => #<TZInfo::Country: US>\nc.name\n# => \"United States\"\n```\nThe `zone_identifiers` method returns a list of the time zone identifiers used\nin a country:\n```ruby\nc.zone_identifiers\n# => [\"America/New_York\", \"America/Detroit\", ..., \"Pacific/Honolulu\"]\n```\nThe `zone_info` method returns further information about the time zones used in\na country as an `Array` of `TZInfo::CountryTimezone` instances:\n```ruby\nzi = c.zone_info.first\nzi.identifier               # => \"America/New_York\"\nzi.latitude.to_f.round(5)   # => 40.71417\nzi.longitude.to_f.round(5)  # => -74.00639\nzi.description              # => \"Eastern (most areas)\"\n```\nThe `zones` method returns an `Array` of `TZInfo::Timezone` instances for a\ncountry. A `TZInfo::Timezone` instance can be obtained from a\n`TZInfo::CountryTimezone` using the `timezone` method:\n```ruby\nzi.timezone.to_local(Time.utc(2018, 2, 1, 12, 30, 0))\n# => 2018-02-01 07:30:00 -0500\n```\nFor further detail, please refer to the API documentation for the\n`TZInfo::Timezone` and `TZInfo::Country` classes.\n## Time Zone Selection\nThe Time Zone Database maintainers recommend that time zone identifiers are not\nmade visible to end-users (see [Names of\ntimezones](https://data.iana.org/time-zones/theory.html#naming)).\nInstead of displaying a list of time zone identifiers, time zones can be\nselected by the user's country. Call `TZInfo::Country.all` to obtain a list of\n`TZInfo::Country` objects, each with a unique `code` and a `name` that can be\nused for display purposes.\nMost countries have a single time zone. When choosing such a country, the time\nzone can be inferred and selected automatically.\n```ruby\ncroatia = TZInfo::Country.get('HR')\n# => #<TZInfo::Country: HR>\ncroatia.zone_info.length\n# => 1\ncroatia.zone_info[0].identifier\n# => \"Europe/Belgrade\"\n```\nSome countries have multiple time zones. The `zone_info` method can be used\nto obtain a list of user-friendly descriptions of the available options:\n```ruby\naustralia = TZInfo::Country.get('AU')\n# => #<TZInfo::Country: AU>\naustralia.zone_info.length\n# => 13\naustralia.zone_info.map {|i| [i.identifier, i.description] }\n# => [[\"Australia/Lord_Howe\", \"Lord Howe Island\"],\n#     [\"Antarctica/Macquarie\", \"Macquarie Island\"],\n#     ...\n#     [\"Australia/Eucla\", \"Western Australia (Eucla)\"]]\n```\nPlease note that country information available through TZInfo is intended as an\naid to help users select a time zone data appropriate for their practical needs.\nIt is not intended to take or endorse any position on legal or territorial\nclaims.\n## Compatibility\nTZInfo v2.0.0 requires a minimum of Ruby MRI 1.9.3 or JRuby 1.7 (in 1.9 mode or\nlater).\n## Thread-Safety\nThe `TZInfo::Country` and `TZInfo::Timezone` classes are thread-safe. It is safe\nto use class and instance methods of `TZInfo::Country` and `TZInfo::Timezone` in\nconcurrently executing threads. Instances of both classes can be shared across\nthread boundaries.\n## Documentation\nAPI documentation for TZInfo is available on\n[RubyDoc.info](https://www.rubydoc.info/gems/tzinfo/).\n## License\nTZInfo is released under the MIT license, see LICENSE for details.\n## Source Code\nSource code for TZInfo is available on\n[GitHub](https://github.com/tzinfo/tzinfo).\n## Issue Tracker\nPlease post any bugs, issues, feature requests or questions about TZInfo to the\n[GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/tzinfo/tzinfo/issues).\nIssues with the underlying time zone data should be raised on the\n[Time Zone Database Discussion mailing list](https://mm.icann.org/mailman/listinfo/tz).\nCopyright (c) 2005-2022 Philip Ross\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\nthis software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies\nof the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do\nso, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
