The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n   5.

Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n   7.

In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only\n    and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices\n    within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to\n    the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution\n    notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.\n    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may\n    provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use,\n    reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such\n    Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and\n    distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in\n    this License.\n5.  Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any\n    Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the\n    Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without\n    any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing\n    herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement\n    you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n6.  Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names,\n    trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as\n    required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the\n    Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n7.  Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in\n    writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its\n    Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY\n    KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any\n    warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or\n    FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in\n    tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by\n    applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to\n    in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including\n    any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any\n    character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability\n    to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n    work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other\n    commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of\n    the possibility of such damages.\n9.  Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or\n    Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for,\n    acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations\n    and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such\n    obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole\n    responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You\n    agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any\n    liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by\n    reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\nAPPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

These layers\nare used to consolidate code for sending out forgotten passwords, welcome\nwishes on signup, invoices for billing, and any other use case that requires\na written notification to either a person or another system.\nAction Mailer is in essence a wrapper around Action Controller and the\nMail gem.  It provides a way to make emails using templates in the same\nway that Action Controller renders views using templates.\nAdditionally, an Action Mailer class can be used to process incoming email,\nsuch as allowing a blog to accept new posts from an email (which could even\nhave been sent from a phone).\nYou can read more about Action Mailer in the {Action Mailer Basics}[https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/action_mailer_basics.html] guide.\n== Sending emails\nThe framework works by initializing any instance variables you want to be\navailable in the email template, followed by a call to +mail+ to deliver\nthe email.\nThis can be as simple as:\n  class Notifier < ActionMailer::Base\n    default from: 'system@loudthinking.com'\n    def welcome(recipient)\n      @recipient = recipient\n      mail(to: recipient,\n           subject: \"[Signed up] Welcome #{recipient}\")\n    end\n  end\nThe body of the email is created by using an Action View template (regular\nERB) that has the instance variables that are declared in the mailer action.\nSo the corresponding body template for the method above could look like this:\n  Hello there,\n  Mr. <%= @recipient %>\n  Thank you for signing up!\nIf the recipient was given as \"david@loudthinking.com\", the email\ngenerated would look like this:\n  Date: Mon, 25 Jan 2010 22:48:09 +1100\n  From: system@loudthinking.com\n  To: david@loudthinking.com\n  Message-ID: <4b5d84f9dd6a5_7380800b81ac29578@void.loudthinking.com.mail>\n  Subject: [Signed up] Welcome david@loudthinking.com\n  Mime-Version: 1.0\n  Content-Type: text/plain;\n  \tcharset=\"US-ASCII\";\n  Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\n  Hello there,\n  Mr. david@loudthinking.com\n  Thank you for signing up!\nIn order to send mails, you simply call the method and then call +deliver_now+ on the return value.\nCalling the method returns a Mail Message object:\n  message = Notifier.welcome(\"david@loudthinking.com\")   # => Returns a Mail::Message object\n  message.deliver_now                                    # => delivers the email\nOr you can just chain the methods together like:\n  Notifier.welcome(\"david@loudthinking.com\").deliver_now # Creates the email and sends it immediately\n== Setting defaults\nIt is possible to set default values that will be used in every method in your\nAction Mailer class. To implement this functionality, you just call the public\nclass method +default+ which you get for free from <tt>ActionMailer::Base</tt>.\nThis method accepts a Hash as the parameter. You can use any of the headers,\nemail messages have, like +:from+ as the key. You can also pass in a string as\nthe key, like \"Content-Type\", but Action Mailer does this out of the box for you,\nso you won't need to worry about that. Finally, it is also possible to pass in a\nProc that will get evaluated when it is needed.\nNote that every value you set with this method will get overwritten if you use the\nsame key in your mailer method.\nExample:\n  class AuthenticationMailer < ActionMailer::Base\n    default from: \"awesome@application.com\", subject: Proc.new { \"E-mail was generated at #{Time.now}\" }\n    .....\n  end\n== Configuration\nThe Base class has the full list of configuration options. Here's an example:\n  ActionMailer::Base.smtp_settings = {\n    address:        'smtp.yourserver.com', # default: localhost\n    port:           '25',                  # default: 25\n    user_name:      'user',\n    password:       'pass',\n    authentication: :plain                 # :plain, :login or :cram_md5\n  }\n== Download and installation\nThe latest version of Action Mailer can be installed with RubyGems:\n  $ gem install actionmailer\nSource code can be downloaded as part of the Rails project on GitHub:\n* https://github.com/rails/rails/tree/main/actionmailer\n== License\nAction Mailer is released under the MIT license:\n* https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT\n== Support\nAPI documentation is at\n* https://api.rubyonrails.org\nBug reports for the Ruby on Rails project can be filed here:\n* https://github.com/rails/rails/issues\nFeature requests should be discussed on the rails-core mailing list here:\n* https://discuss.rubyonrails.org/c/rubyonrails-core\nCopyright (c) 2004-2022 David Heinemeier Hansson\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n\"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND\nNONINFRINGEMENT.

It\nprovides mechanisms for *routing* (mapping request URLs to actions), defining\n*controllers* that implement actions, and generating responses by rendering\n*views*, which are templates of various formats. In short, Action Pack\nprovides the view and controller layers in the MVC paradigm.\nIt consists of several modules:\n* Action Dispatch, which parses information about the web request, handles\n  routing as defined by the user, and does advanced processing related to HTTP\n  such as MIME-type negotiation, decoding parameters in POST, PATCH, or PUT bodies,\n  handling HTTP caching logic, cookies and sessions.\n* Action Controller, which provides a base controller class that can be\n  subclassed to implement filters and actions to handle requests. The result\n  of an action is typically content generated from views.\nWith the Ruby on Rails framework, users only directly interface with the\nAction Controller module.

These jobs can be everything from regularly scheduled\nclean-ups, to billing charges, to mailings. Anything that can be chopped up into\nsmall units of work and run in parallel, really.\nIt also serves as the backend for Action Mailer's #deliver_later functionality\nthat makes it easy to turn any mailing into a job for running later. That's\none of the most common jobs in a modern web application: sending emails outside\nof the request-response cycle, so the user doesn't have to wait on it.\nThe main point is to ensure that all Rails apps will have a job infrastructure\nin place, even if it's in the form of an \"immediate runner\". We can then have\nframework features and other gems build on top of that, without having to worry\nabout API differences between Delayed Job and Resque. Picking your queuing\nbackend becomes more of an operational concern, then. And you'll be able to\nswitch between them without having to rewrite your jobs.\nYou can read more about Active Job in the [Active Job Basics](https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/active_job_basics.html) guide.\n## Usage\nTo learn how to use your preferred queuing backend see its adapter\ndocumentation at\n[ActiveJob::QueueAdapters](https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveJob/QueueAdapters.html).\nDeclare a job like so:\n```ruby\nclass MyJob < ActiveJob::Base\n  queue_as :my_jobs\n  def perform(record)\n    record.do_work\n  end\nend\n```\nEnqueue a job like so:\n```ruby\nMyJob.perform_later record  # Enqueue a job to be performed as soon as the queuing system is free.\n```\n```ruby\nMyJob.set(wait_until: Date.tomorrow.noon).perform_later(record)  # Enqueue a job to be performed tomorrow at noon.\n```\n```ruby\nMyJob.set(wait: 1.week).perform_later(record) # Enqueue a job to be performed 1 week from now.\n```\nThat's it!\n## GlobalID support\nActive Job supports [GlobalID serialization](https://github.com/rails/globalid/) for parameters. This makes it possible\nto pass live Active Record objects to your job instead of class/id pairs, which\nyou then have to manually deserialize. Before, jobs would look like this:\n```ruby\nclass TrashableCleanupJob\n  def perform(trashable_class, trashable_id, depth)\n    trashable = trashable_class.constantize.find(trashable_id)\n    trashable.cleanup(depth)\n  end\nend\n```\nNow you can simply do:\n```ruby\nclass TrashableCleanupJob\n  def perform(trashable, depth)\n    trashable.cleanup(depth)\n  end\nend\n```\nThis works with any class that mixes in GlobalID::Identification, which\nby default has been mixed into Active Record classes.\n## Supported queuing systems\nActive Job has built-in adapters for multiple queuing backends (Sidekiq,\nResque, Delayed Job and others). To get an up-to-date list of the adapters\nsee the API Documentation for [ActiveJob::QueueAdapters](https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveJob/QueueAdapters.html).\n**Please note:** We are not accepting pull requests for new adapters. We\nencourage library authors to provide an ActiveJob adapter as part of\ntheir gem, or as a stand-alone gem.

Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n9.

However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n   of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\nAPPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n   To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n   boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n   replaced with your own identifying information.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"{}\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

It can\nalso be useful for normalizing and sanitizing data.\nIt is an extraction and improvement of the string code from\n[FriendlyId](http://github.com/norman/friendly_id). I have released this as a\nseparate library to help developers who want to create libraries similar to\nFriendlyId.\n## Features / Usage\n### Transliterate UTF-8 characters to ASCII\n    \"GÃ¶lcÃ¼k, Turkey\".to_slug.transliterate.to_s #=> \"Golcuk, Turkey\"\n### Locale sensitive transliteration, with support for many languages\n    \"JÃ¼rgen MÃ¼ller\".to_slug.transliterate.to_s           #=> \"Jurgen Muller\"\n    \"JÃ¼rgen MÃ¼ller\".to_slug.transliterate(:german).to_s  #=> \"Juergen Mueller\"\nCurrently supported languages include:\n* Bulgarian\n* Danish\n* German\n* Greek\n* Macedonian\n* Norwegian\n* Romanian\n* Russian\n* Serbian\n* Spanish\n* Swedish\n* Ukrainian\nI'll gladly accept contributions from fluent speakers to support more languages.\n### Strip non-ASCII characters\n    \"GÃ¶lcÃ¼k, Turkey\".to_slug.to_ascii.to_s #=> \"Glck, Turkey\"\n### Truncate by characters\n    \"Ã¼Ã¼Ã¼\".to_slug.truncate(2).to_s #=> \"Ã¼Ã¼\"\n### Truncate by bytes\nThis can be useful to ensure the generated slug will fit in a database column\nwhose length is limited by bytes rather than UTF-8 characters.\n    \"Ã¼Ã¼Ã¼\".to_slug.truncate_bytes(2).to_s #=> \"Ã¼\"\n### Remove punctuation chars\n    \"this is, um, **really** cool, huh?\".to_slug.word_chars.to_s #=> \"this is um really cool huh\"\n### All-in-one\n    \"GÃ¶lcÃ¼k, Turkey\".to_slug.normalize.to_s #=> \"golcuk-turkey\"\n### Other stuff\n#### Using Babosa With FriendlyId 4\n    require \"babosa\"\n    class Person < ActiveRecord::Base\n      friendly_id :name, use: :slugged\n      def normalize_friendly_id(input)\n        input.to_s.to_slug.normalize(transliterations: :russian).to_s\n      end\n    end\n#### Pedantic UTF-8 support\nBabosa goes out of its way to handle [nasty Unicode issues you might never think\nyou would have](https://github.com/norman/enc/blob/master/equivalence.rb) by\nchecking, sanitizing and normalizing your string input.\nIt will automatically use whatever Unicode library you have loaded before\nBabosa, or fall back to a simple built-in library. Supported\nUnicode libraries include:\n* Java (only on JRuby of course)\n* Active Support\n* [Unicode](https://github.com/blackwinter/unicode)\n* Built-in\nThis built-in module is much faster than Active Support but much slower than\nJava or Unicode. It can only do **very** naive Unicode composition to ensure\nthat, for example, \"Ã©\" will always be composed to a single codepoint rather than\nan \"e\" and a \"Â´\" - making it safe to use as a hash key.\nBut seriously - save yourself the headache and install a real Unicode library.\nIf you are using Babosa with a language that uses the Cyrillic alphabet, Babosa\nrequires either Unicode, Active Support or Java.\n#### Ruby Method Names\nBabosa can also generate strings for Ruby method names. (Yes, Ruby 1.9 can use\nUTF-8 chars in method names, but you may not want to):\n    \"this is a method\".to_slug.to_ruby_method! #=> this_is_a_method\n    \"Ã¼ber cool stuff!\".to_slug.to_ruby_method! #=> uber_cool_stuff!\n    # You can also disallow trailing punctuation chars\n    \"Ã¼ber cool stuff!\".to_slug.to_ruby_method(false) #=> uber_cool_stuff\n#### Easy to Extend\nYou can add custom transliterators for your language with very little code. For\nexample here's the transliterator for German:\n    # encoding: utf-8\n    module Babosa\n      module Transliterator\n        class German < Latin\n          APPROXIMATIONS = {\n            \"Ã¤\" => \"ae\",\n            \"Ã¶\" => \"oe\",\n            \"Ã¼\" => \"ue\",\n            \"Ã\" => \"Ae\",\n            \"Ã\" => \"Oe\",\n            \"Ã\" => \"Ue\"\n          }\n        end\n      end\n    end\nAnd a spec (you can use this as a template):\n    # encoding: utf-8\n    require File.expand_path(\"../../spec_helper\", __FILE__)\n    describe Babosa::Transliterator::German do\n      let(:t) { described_class.instance }\n      it_behaves_like \"a latin transliterator\"\n      it \"should transliterate Eszett\" do\n        t.transliterate(\"Ã\").should eql(\"ss\")\n      end\n      it \"should transliterate vowels with umlauts\" do\n        t.transliterate(\"Ã¼Ã¶Ã¤\").should eql(\"ueoeae\")\n      end\n    end\n### Rails 3.x and higher\nSome of Babosa's functionality was added to Active Support 3.0.0.\nBabosa now differs from ActiveSupport primarily in that it supports non-Latin\nstrings by default, and has per-locale ASCII transliterations already baked-in.\nIf you are considering using Babosa with Rails, you may want to first take a\nlook at Active Support's\n[transliterate](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveSupport/Inflector.html#method-i-transliterate)\nand\n[parameterize](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveSupport/Inflector.html#method-i-parameterize)\nto see if they suit your needs.\n### Babosa vs. Stringex\nBabosa provides much of the functionality provided by the\n[Stringex](https://github.com/rsl/stringex) gem, but in the subjective opinion\nof the author, is for most use cases a better choice.\n#### Fewer Features\nStringex offers functionality for storing slugs in an Active Record model, like\na simple version of [FriendlyId](http://github.com/norman/friendly_id), in\naddition to string processing. Babosa only does string processing.\n#### Less Aggressive Unicode Transliteration\nStringex uses an agressive Unicode to ASCII mapping which outputs gibberish for\nalmost anything but Western European langages and Mandarin Chinese. Babosa\nsupports only languages for which fluent speakers have provided\ntransliterations, to ensure that the output makes sense to users.\n#### Unicode Support\nStringex does no Unicode normalization or validation before transliterating\nstrings, so if you pass in strings with encoding errors or with different\nUnicode normalizations, you'll get unpredictable results.\n#### No Locale Assumptions\nBabosa avoids making assumptions about locales like Stringex does, so it doesn't\noffer transliterations like this out of the box:\n    \"$12 worth of Ruby power\".to_url => \"12-dollars-worth-of-ruby-power\"\nThis is because the symbol \"$\" is used in many Latin American countries for the\npeso. Stringex does this in many places, for example, transliterating all Han\ncharacters into Pinyin, effectively treating Japanese text as if it were\nMandarin Chinese.\n### More info\nPlease see the [API docs](http://rubydoc.info/github/norman/babosa/master/frames) and source code for\nmore info.\n## Getting it\nBabosa can be installed via Rubygems:\n    gem install babosa\nYou can get the source code from its [Github repository](http://github.com/norman/babosa).\nBabosa is tested to be compatible with Ruby 2.x, JRuby 1.7+, and\nRubinius 2.x It's probably compatible with other Rubies as well.\n## Reporting bugs\nPlease use Babosa's [Github issue\ntracker](http://github.com/norman/babosa/issues).\n## Misc\n\"Babosa\" means slug in Spanish.\n## Author\n[Norman Clarke](http://njclarke.com)\n## Contributors\nMany thanks to the following people for their help:\n* [Dmitry A.

See the [**API reference**](http://bluebirdjs.com/docs/api-reference.html) here.\nFor bluebird 2.x documentation and files, see the [2.x tree](https://github.com/petkaantonov/bluebird/tree/2.x).\n### Note \nPromises in Node.js 10 are significantly faster than before. Bluebird still includes a lot of features like cancellation, iteration methods and warnings that native promises don't. If you are using Bluebird for performance rather than for those - please consider giving native promises a shot and running the benchmarks yourself.\n# Questions and issues\nThe [github issue tracker](https://github.com/petkaantonov/bluebird/issues) is **_only_** for bug reports and feature requests. Anything else, such as questions for help in using the library, should be posted in [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/bluebird) under tags `promise` and `bluebird`.\n## Thanks\nThanks to BrowserStack for providing us with a free account which lets us support old browsers like IE8. \n# License\nThe MIT License (MIT)\nCopyright (c) 2013-2019 Petka Antonov\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Here\nis the list of them in the order of appearance in the function name:\n* `i` - perform operation in-place, storing the result in the host object (on\n  which the method was invoked). Might be used to avoid number allocation costs\n* `u` - unsigned, ignore the sign of operands when performing operation, or\n  always return positive value. Second case applies to reduction operations\n  like `mod()`. In such cases if the result will be negative - modulo will be\n  added to the result to make it positive\n### Postfixes\nThe only available postfix at the moment is:\n* `n` - which means that the argument of the function must be a plain JavaScript\n  Number. Decimals are not supported.\n### Examples\n* `a.iadd(b)` - perform addition on `a` and `b`, storing the result in `a`\n* `a.umod(b)` - reduce `a` modulo `b`, returning positive value\n* `a.iushln(13)` - shift bits of `a` left by 13\n## Instructions\nPrefixes/postfixes are put in parens at the of the line. `endian` - could be\neither `le` (little-endian) or `be` (big-endian).\n### Utilities\n* `a.clone()` - clone number\n* `a.toString(base, length)` - convert to base-string and pad with zeroes\n* `a.toNumber()` - convert to Javascript Number (limited to 53 bits)\n* `a.toJSON()` - convert to JSON compatible hex string (alias of `toString(16)`)\n* `a.toArray(endian, length)` - convert to byte `Array`, and optionally zero\n  pad to length, throwing if already exceeding\n* `a.toArrayLike(type, endian, length)` - convert to an instance of `type`,\n  which must behave like an `Array`\n* `a.toBuffer(endian, length)` - convert to Node.js Buffer (if available). For\n  compatibility with browserify and similar tools, use this instead:\n  `a.toArrayLike(Buffer, endian, length)`\n* `a.bitLength()` - get number of bits occupied\n* `a.zeroBits()` - return number of less-significant consequent zero bits\n  (example: `1010000` has 4 zero bits)\n* `a.byteLength()` - return number of bytes occupied\n* `a.isNeg()` - true if the number is negative\n* `a.isEven()` - no comments\n* `a.isOdd()` - no comments\n* `a.isZero()` - no comments\n* `a.cmp(b)` - compare numbers and return `-1` (a `<` b), `0` (a `==` b), or `1` (a `>` b)\n  depending on the comparison result (`ucmp`, `cmpn`)\n* `a.lt(b)` - `a` less than `b` (`n`)\n* `a.lte(b)` - `a` less than or equals `b` (`n`)\n* `a.gt(b)` - `a` greater than `b` (`n`)\n* `a.gte(b)` - `a` greater than or equals `b` (`n`)\n* `a.eq(b)` - `a` equals `b` (`n`)\n* `a.toTwos(width)` - convert to two's complement representation, where `width` is bit width\n* `a.fromTwos(width)` - convert from two's complement representation, where `width` is the bit width\n* `BN.isBN(object)` - returns true if the supplied `object` is a BN.js instance\n### Arithmetics\n* `a.neg()` - negate sign (`i`)\n* `a.abs()` - absolute value (`i`)\n* `a.add(b)` - addition (`i`, `n`, `in`)\n* `a.sub(b)` - subtraction (`i`, `n`, `in`)\n* `a.mul(b)` - multiply (`i`, `n`, `in`)\n* `a.sqr()` - square (`i`)\n* `a.pow(b)` - raise `a` to the power of `b`\n* `a.div(b)` - divide (`divn`, `idivn`)\n* `a.mod(b)` - reduct (`u`, `n`) (but no `umodn`)\n* `a.divRound(b)` - rounded division\n### Bit operations\n* `a.or(b)` - or (`i`, `u`, `iu`)\n* `a.and(b)` - and (`i`, `u`, `iu`, `andln`) (NOTE: `andln` is going to be replaced\n  with `andn` in future)\n* `a.xor(b)` - xor (`i`, `u`, `iu`)\n* `a.setn(b)` - set specified bit to `1`\n* `a.shln(b)` - shift left (`i`, `u`, `iu`)\n* `a.shrn(b)` - shift right (`i`, `u`, `iu`)\n* `a.testn(b)` - test if specified bit is set\n* `a.maskn(b)` - clear bits with indexes higher or equal to `b` (`i`)\n* `a.bincn(b)` - add `1 << b` to the number\n* `a.notn(w)` - not (for the width specified by `w`) (`i`)\n### Reduction\n* `a.gcd(b)` - GCD\n* `a.egcd(b)` - Extended GCD results (`{ a: ..., b: ..., gcd: ... }`)\n* `a.invm(b)` - inverse `a` modulo `b`\n## Fast reduction\nWhen doing lots of reductions using the same modulo, it might be beneficial to\nuse some tricks: like [Montgomery multiplication][0], or using special algorithm\nfor [Mersenne Prime][1].\n### Reduction context\nTo enable this tricks one should create a reduction context:\n```js\nvar red = BN.red(num);\n```\nwhere `num` is just a BN instance.\nOr:\n```js\nvar red = BN.red(primeName);\n```\nWhere `primeName` is either of these [Mersenne Primes][1]:\n* `'k256'`\n* `'p224'`\n* `'p192'`\n* `'p25519'`\nOr:\n```js\nvar red = BN.mont(num);\n```\nTo reduce numbers with [Montgomery trick][0]. `.mont()` is generally faster than\n`.red(num)`, but slower than `BN.red(primeName)`.\n### Converting numbers\nBefore performing anything in reduction context - numbers should be converted\nto it. Usually, this means that one should:\n* Convert inputs to reducted ones\n* Operate on them in reduction context\n* Convert outputs back from the reduction context\nHere is how one may convert numbers to `red`:\n```js\nvar redA = a.toRed(red);\n```\nWhere `red` is a reduction context created using instructions above\nHere is how to convert them back:\n```js\nvar a = redA.fromRed();\n```\n### Red instructions\nMost of the instructions from the very start of this readme have their\ncounterparts in red context:\n* `a.redAdd(b)`, `a.redIAdd(b)`\n* `a.redSub(b)`, `a.redISub(b)`\n* `a.redShl(num)`\n* `a.redMul(b)`, `a.redIMul(b)`\n* `a.redSqr()`, `a.redISqr()`\n* `a.redSqrt()` - square root modulo reduction context's prime\n* `a.redInvm()` - modular inverse of the number\n* `a.redNeg()`\n* `a.redPow(b)` - modular exponentiation\n## LICENSE\nThis software is licensed under the MIT License.\nCopyright Fedor Indutny, 2015.\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a\ncopy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n\"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit\npersons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the\nfollowing conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included\nin all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

The following example will consider\nany of the following browsers as a modern:\n```ruby\n# Expects an Browser instance,\n# like in `Browser.new(user_agent, accept_language: language)`.\ndef modern_browser?(browser)\n  [\n    browser.chrome?(\">= 65\"),\n    browser.safari?(\">= 10\"),\n    browser.firefox?(\">= 52\"),\n    browser.ie?(\">= 11\") && !browser.compatibility_view?,\n    browser.edge?(\">= 15\"),\n    browser.opera?(\">= 50\"),\n    browser.facebook?\n      && browser.safari_webapp_mode?\n      && browser.webkit_full_version.to_i >= 602\n  ].any?\nend\n```\n### Rails integration\nJust add it to the Gemfile.\n```ruby\ngem \"browser\"\n```\nThis adds a helper method called `browser`, that inspects your current user\nagent.\n```erb\n<% if browser.ie?(6) %>\n  <p class=\"disclaimer\">You're running an older IE version. Please update it!</p>\n<% end %>\n```\nIf you want to use Browser on your Rails app but don't want to taint your\ncontroller, use the following line on your Gemfile:\n```ruby\ngem \"browser\", require: \"browser/browser\"\n```\n### Accept Language\nParses the accept-language header from an HTTP request and produces an array of\nlanguage objects sorted by quality.\n```ruby\nbrowser = Browser.new(\"Some User Agent\", accept_language: \"en-us\")\nbrowser.accept_language.class\n#=> Array\nlanguage = browser.accept_language.first\nlanguage.code\n#=> \"en\"\nlanguage.region\n#=> \"US\"\nlanguage.full\n#=> \"en-US\"\nlanguage.quality\n#=> 1.0\nlanguage.name\n#=> \"English/United States\"\n```\nResult is always sorted in quality order from highest to lowest. As per the HTTP\nspec:\n- omitting the quality value implies 1.0.\n- quality value equal to zero means that is not accepted by the client.\n### Internet Explorer\nInternet Explorer has a compatibility view mode that allows newer versions\n(IE8+) to run as an older version. Browser will always return the navigator\nversion, ignoring the compatibility view version, when defined. If you need to\nget the engine's version, you have to use `Browser#msie_version` and\n`Browser#msie_full_version`.\nSo, let's say an user activates compatibility view in a IE11 browser. This is\nwhat you'll get:\n```ruby\nbrowser.version\n#=> 11\nbrowser.full_version\n#=> 11.0\nbrowser.msie_version\n#=> 7\nbrowser.msie_full_version\n#=> 7.0\nbrowser.compatibility_view?\n#=> true\n```\nThis behavior changed in `v1.0.0`; previously there wasn't a way of getting the\nreal browser version.\n### Safari\niOS webviews and web apps aren't detected as Safari anymore, so be aware of that\nif that's your case. You can use a combination of platform and webkit detection\nto do whatever you want.\n```ruby\n# iPad's Safari running as web app mode.\nbrowser = Browser.new(\"Mozilla/5.0 (iPad; U; CPU OS 3_2_1 like Mac OS X; en-us) AppleWebKit/531.21.10 (KHTML, like Gecko) Mobile/7B405\")\nbrowser.safari?\n#=> false\nbrowser.webkit?\n#=> true\nbrowser.platform.ios?\n#=> true\n```\n### Bots\nThe bot detection is quite aggressive. Anything that matches at least one of the\nfollowing requirements will be considered a bot.\n- Empty user agent string\n- User agent that matches `/crawl|fetch|search|monitoring|spider|bot/`\n- Any known bot listed under\n  [bots.yml](https://github.com/fnando/browser/blob/master/bots.yml)\nTo add custom matchers, you can add a callable object to\n`Browser::Bot.matchers`. The following example matches everything that has a\n`externalhit` substring on it. The bot name will always be `General Bot`.\n```ruby\nBrowser::Bot.matchers << ->(ua, _browser) { ua.match?(/externalhit/i) }\n```\nTo clear all matchers, including the ones that are bundled, use\n`Browser::Bot.matchers.clear`. You can re-add built-in matchers by doing the\nfollowing:\n```ruby\nBrowser::Bot.matchers += Browser::Bot.default_matchers\n```\nTo restore v2's bot detection, remove the following matchers:\n```ruby\nBrowser::Bot.matchers.delete(Browser::Bot::KeywordMatcher)\nBrowser::Bot.matchers.delete(Browser::Bot::EmptyUserAgentMatcher)\n```\n### Middleware\nYou can use the `Browser::Middleware` to redirect user agents.\n```ruby\nuse Browser::Middleware do\n  redirect_to \"/upgrade\" if browser.ie?\nend\n```\nIf you're using Rails, you can use the route helper methods. Just add something\nlike the following to a initializer file (`config/initializers/browser.rb`).\n```ruby\nRails.configuration.middleware.use Browser::Middleware do\n  redirect_to upgrade_path if browser.ie?\nend\n```\nIf you need access to the `Rack::Request` object (e.g. to exclude a path), you\ncan do so with `request`.\n```ruby\nRails.configuration.middleware.use Browser::Middleware do\n  redirect_to upgrade_path if browser.ie? && request.env[\"PATH_INFO\"] != \"/exclude_me\"\nend\n```\n### Restrictions\n- User agent has a size limit of 2048 bytes. This can be customized through\n  `Browser.user_agent_size_limit=(size)`.\n- Accept-Language has a size limit of 2048 bytes. This can be customized through\n  `Browser.accept_language_size_limit=(size)`.\nIf size is not respected, then `Browser::Error` is raised.\n```ruby\nBrowser.user_agent_size_limit = 4096\nBrowser.accept_language_size_limit = 4096\n```\n## Development\n### Versioning\nThis library follows http://semver.org.\n### Writing code\nOnce you've made your great commits (include tests, please):\n1. [Fork](http://help.github.com/forking/) browser\n2. Create a topic branch - `git checkout -b my_branch`\n3. Push to your branch - `git push origin my_branch`\n4. Create a pull request\n5. That's it!\nPlease respect the indentation rules and code style. And use 2 spaces, not tabs.\nAnd don't touch the version thing.\n## Configuring environment\nTo configure your environment, you must have Ruby and bundler installed. Then\nrun `bundle install` to install all dependencies.\nTo run tests, execute `./bin/rake`.\n### Adding new features\nBefore using your time to code a new feature, open a ticket asking if it makes\nsense and if it's on this project's scope.\nDon't forget to add a new entry to `CHANGELOG.md`.\n#### Adding a new bot\n1. Add the user agent to `test/ua_bots.yml`.\n2. Add the readable name to `bots.yml`. The key must be something that matches\n   the user agent, in lowercased text.\n3. Run tests.\nDon't forget to add a new entry to `CHANGELOG.md`.\n#### Adding a new search engine\n1. Add the user agent to `test/ua_search_engines.yml`.\n2. Add the same user agent to `test/ua_bots.yml`.\n3. Add the readable name to `search_engines.yml`. The key must be something that\n   matches the user agent, in lowercased text.\n4. Run tests.\nDon't forget to add a new entry to `CHANGELOG.md`.\n#### Wrong browser/platform/device detection\nIf you know how to fix it, follow the \"Writing code\" above. Open an issue\notherwise; make sure you fill in the issue template with all the required\ninformation.\n## Maintainer\n- Nando Vieira - http://nandovieira.com\n## Contributors\n- https://github.com/fnando/browser/contributors\n## License\n(The MIT License)\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\nthis software and associated documentation files (the 'Software'), to deal in\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of\nthe Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so,\nsubject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS\nFOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

This allowed\nattribute values to explicitly reference entities, which was\noccasionally used by a small number of developers.  Since strings\ncould always be explicitly escaped by hand, this was not a major\nrestriction in functionality.\nHowever, it did surprise most users of builder.  Since the body text is\nnormally escaped, everybody expected the attribute values to be\nescaped as well.  Escaped attribute values were the number one support\nrequest on the 1.x Builder series.\nStarting with Builder version 2.0.0, all attribute values expressed as\nstrings will be processed and the appropriate characters will be\nescaped (e.g. \"&\" will be translated to \"&amp;amp;\").  Attribute values\nthat are expressed as Symbol values will not be processed for escaped\ncharacters and will be unchanged in output. (Yes, this probably counts\nas Symbol abuse, but the convention is convenient and flexible).\nExample:\n```ruby\n  xml = Builder::XmlMarkup.new\n  xml.sample(:escaped=>\"This&That\", :unescaped=>:\"Here&amp;There\")\n  xml.target!  =>\n    <sample escaped=\"This&amp;That\" unescaped=\"Here&amp;There\"/>\n```\n### Version 1.0.0 Compatibility Changes\nVersion 1.0.0 introduces some changes that are not backwards\ncompatible with earlier releases of builder.  The main areas of\nincompatibility are:\n* Keyword based arguments to +new+ (rather than positional based).  It\n  was found that a developer would often like to specify indentation\n  without providing an explicit target, or specify a target without\n  indentation.  Keyword based arguments handle this situation nicely.\n* Builder must now be an explicit target for markup tags.  Instead of\n  writing\n```ruby\n    xml_markup = Builder::XmlMarkup.new\n    xml_markup.div { strong(\"text\") }\n```\n  you need to write\n```ruby\n    xml_markup = Builder::XmlMarkup.new\n    xml_markup.div { xml_markup.strong(\"text\") }\n```\n* The builder object is passed as a parameter to all nested markup\n  blocks.  This allows you to create a short alias for the builder\n  object that can be used within the block.  For example, the previous\n  example can be written as:\n```ruby\n    xml_markup = Builder::XmlMarkup.new\n    xml_markup.div { |xml| xml.strong(\"text\") }\n```\n* If you have both a pre-1.0 and a post-1.0 gem of builder installed,\n  you can choose which version to use through the RubyGems\n  +require_gem+ facility.\n```ruby\n    require_gem 'builder', \"~> 0.0\"   # Gets the old version\n    require_gem 'builder', \"~> 1.0\"   # Gets the new version\n```\n## Features\n* XML Comments are supported ...\n```ruby\n    xml_markup.comment! \"This is a comment\"\n      #=>  <!-- This is a comment -->\n```\n* XML processing instructions are supported ...\n```ruby\n    xml_markup.instruct! :xml, :version=>\"1.0\", :encoding=>\"UTF-8\"\n      #=>  <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n```\n  If the processing instruction is omitted, it defaults to \"xml\".\n  When the processing instruction is \"xml\", the defaults attributes\n  are:\n  <b>version</b>: 1.0\n  <b>encoding</b>: \"UTF-8\"\n  (NOTE: if the encoding is set to \"UTF-8\" and $KCODE is set to\n  \"UTF8\", then Builder will emit UTF-8 encoded strings rather than\n  encoding non-ASCII characters as entities.)\n* XML entity declarations are now supported to a small degree.\n```ruby\n    xml_markup.declare! :DOCTYPE, :chapter, :SYSTEM, \"../dtds/chapter.dtd\"\n      #=>  <!DOCTYPE chapter SYSTEM \"../dtds/chapter.dtd\">\n```\n  The parameters to a declare! method must be either symbols or\n  strings. Symbols are inserted without quotes, and strings are\n  inserted with double quotes.  Attribute-like arguments in hashes are\n  not allowed.\n  If you need to have an argument to declare! be inserted without\n  quotes, but the argument does not conform to the typical Ruby\n  syntax for symbols, then use the :\"string\" form to specify a symbol.\n  For example:\n```ruby\n    xml_markup.declare! :ELEMENT, :chapter, :\"(title,para+)\"\n      #=>  <!ELEMENT chapter (title,para+)>\n```\n  Nested entity declarations are allowed.  For example:\n```ruby\n    @xml_markup.declare! :DOCTYPE, :chapter do |x|\n      x.declare! :ELEMENT, :chapter, :\"(title,para+)\"\n      x.declare! :ELEMENT, :title, :\"(#PCDATA)\"\n      x.declare! :ELEMENT, :para, :\"(#PCDATA)\"\n    end\n    #=>\n    <!DOCTYPE chapter [\n      <!ELEMENT chapter (title,para+)>\n      <!ELEMENT title (#PCDATA)>\n      <!ELEMENT para (#PCDATA)>\n    ]>\n```\n* Some support for XML namespaces is now available.  If the first\n  argument to a tag call is a symbol, it will be joined to the tag to\n  produce a namespace:tag combination.  It is easier to show this than\n  describe it.\n```ruby\n   xml.SOAP :Envelope do ... end\n```\n  Just put a space before the colon in a namespace to produce the\n  right form for builder (e.g. \"<tt>SOAP:Envelope</tt>\" =>\n  \"<tt>xml.SOAP :Envelope</tt>\")\n* String attribute values are <em>now</em> escaped by default by\n  Builder (<b>NOTE:</b> this is _new_ behavior as of version 2.0).\n  However, occasionally you need to use entities in attribute values.\n  Using a symbol (rather than a string) for an attribute value will\n  cause Builder to not run its quoting/escaping algorithm on that\n  particular value.\n  (<b>Note:</b> The +escape_attrs+ option for builder is now\n  obsolete).\n  Example:\n```ruby\n    xml = Builder::XmlMarkup.new\n    xml.sample(:escaped=>\"This&That\", :unescaped=>:\"Here&amp;There\")\n    xml.target!  =>\n      <sample escaped=\"This&amp;That\" unescaped=\"Here&amp;There\"/>\n```\n* UTF-8 Support\n  Builder correctly translates UTF-8 characters into valid XML.  (New\n  in version 2.0.0).  Thanks to Sam Ruby for the translation code.\n  You can get UTF-8 encoded output by making sure that the XML\n  encoding is set to \"UTF-8\" and that the $KCODE variable is set to\n  \"UTF8\".\n```ruby\n    $KCODE = 'UTF8'\n    xml = Builder::Markup.new\n    xml.instruct!(:xml, :encoding => \"UTF-8\")\n    xml.sample(\"IÃ±tÃ«rnÃ¢tiÃ´nÃ l\")\n    xml.target!  =>\n      \"<sample>IÃ±tÃ«rnÃ¢tiÃ´nÃ l</sample>\"\n```\n## Links\n| Description | Link |\n| :----: | :----: |\n| Documents           | http://builder.rubyforge.org/ |\n| Github Clone        | git://github.com/tenderlove/builder.git |\n| Issue / Bug Reports | https://github.com/tenderlove/builder/issues?state=open |\n## Contact\n| Description | Value                  |\n| :----:      | :----:                 |\n| Author      | Jim Weirich            |\n| Email       | jim.weirich@gmail.com  |\n| Home Page   | http://onestepback.org |\n| License     | MIT Licence (http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.html) |\nCopyright (c) 2003-2012 Jim Weirich (jim.weirich@gmail.com)\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n\"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND\nNONINFRINGEMENT.

If you're on Rails 3, you should use v0.11.0.\n## Getting Started\nStart off by generating an uploader:\n\trails generate uploader Avatar\nthis should give you a file in:\n\tapp/uploaders/avatar_uploader.rb\nCheck out this file for some hints on how you can customize your uploader. It\nshould look something like this:\n```ruby\nclass AvatarUploader < CarrierWave::Uploader::Base\n  storage :file\nend\n```\nYou can use your uploader class to store and retrieve files like this:\n```ruby\nuploader = AvatarUploader.new\nuploader.store!(my_file)\nuploader.retrieve_from_store!('my_file.png')\n```\nCarrierWave gives you a `store` for permanent storage, and a `cache` for\ntemporary storage. You can use different stores, including filesystem\nand cloud storage.\nMost of the time you are going to want to use CarrierWave together with an ORM.\nIt is quite simple to mount uploaders on columns in your model, so you can\nsimply assign files and get going:\n### ActiveRecord\nMake sure you are loading CarrierWave after loading your ORM, otherwise you'll\nneed to require the relevant extension manually, e.g.:\n```ruby\nrequire 'carrierwave/orm/activerecord'\n```\nAdd a string column to the model you want to mount the uploader by creating\na migration:\n\trails g migration add_avatar_to_users avatar:string\n\trails db:migrate\nOpen your model file and mount the uploader:\n```ruby\nclass User < ActiveRecord::Base\n  mount_uploader :avatar, AvatarUploader\nend\n```\nNow you can cache files by assigning them to the attribute, they will\nautomatically be stored when the record is saved.\n```ruby\nu = User.new\nu.avatar = params[:file] # Assign a file like this, or\n# like this\nFile.open('somewhere') do |f|\n  u.avatar = f\nend\nu.save!\nu.avatar.url # => '/url/to/file.png'\nu.avatar.current_path # => 'path/to/file.png'\nu.avatar_identifier # => 'file.png'\n```\n**Note**: `u.avatar` will never return nil, even if there is no photo associated to it.\nTo check if a photo was saved to the model, use `u.avatar.file.nil?` instead.\n### DataMapper, Mongoid, Sequel\nOther ORM support has been extracted into separate gems:\n* [carrierwave-datamapper](https://github.com/carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave-datamapper)\n* [carrierwave-mongoid](https://github.com/carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave-mongoid)\n* [carrierwave-sequel](https://github.com/carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave-sequel)\nThere are more extensions listed in [the wiki](https://github.com/carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave/wiki)\n## Multiple file uploads\nCarrierWave also has convenient support for multiple file upload fields.\n### ActiveRecord\nAdd a column which can store an array. This could be an array column or a JSON\ncolumn for example. Your choice depends on what your database supports. For\nexample, create a migration like this:\n#### For databases with ActiveRecord json data type support (e.g. PostgreSQL, MySQL)\n\trails g migration add_avatars_to_users avatars:json\n\trails db:migrate\n#### For database without ActiveRecord json data type support (e.g. SQLite)\n\trails g migration add_avatars_to_users avatars:string\n\trails db:migrate\n__Note__: JSON datatype doesn't exists in SQLite adapter, that's why you can use a string datatype which will be serialized in model.\nOpen your model file and mount the uploader:\n```ruby\nclass User < ActiveRecord::Base\n  mount_uploaders :avatars, AvatarUploader\n  serialize :avatars, JSON # If you use SQLite, add this line.\nend\n```\nMake sure that you mount the uploader with write (mount_uploaders) with `s` not (mount_uploader)\nin order to avoid errors when uploading multiple files\nMake sure your file input fields are set up as multiple file fields. For\nexample in Rails you'll want to do something like this:\n```erb\n<%= form.file_field :avatars, multiple: true %>\n```\nAlso, make sure your upload controller permits the multiple file upload attribute, *pointing to an empty array in a hash*. For example:\n```ruby\nparams.require(:user).permit(:email, :first_name, :last_name, {avatars: []})\n```\nNow you can select multiple files in the upload dialog (e.g. SHIFT+SELECT), and they will\nautomatically be stored when the record is saved.\n```ruby\nu = User.new(params[:user])\nu.save!\nu.avatars[0].url # => '/url/to/file.png'\nu.avatars[0].current_path # => 'path/to/file.png'\nu.avatars[0].identifier # => 'file.png'\n```\n## Changing the storage directory\nIn order to change where uploaded files are put, just override the `store_dir`\nmethod:\n```ruby\nclass MyUploader < CarrierWave::Uploader::Base\n  def store_dir\n    'public/my/upload/directory'\n  end\nend\n```\nThis works for the file storage as well as Amazon S3 and Rackspace Cloud Files.\nDefine `store_dir` as `nil` if you'd like to store files at the root level.\nIf you store files outside the project root folder, you may want to define `cache_dir` in the same way:\n```ruby\nclass MyUploader < CarrierWave::Uploader::Base\n  def cache_dir\n    '/tmp/projectname-cache'\n  end\nend\n```\n## Securing uploads\nCertain files might be dangerous if uploaded to the wrong location, such as PHP\nfiles or other script files. CarrierWave allows you to specify a whitelist of\nallowed extensions or content types.\nIf you're mounting the uploader, uploading a file with the wrong extension will\nmake the record invalid instead. Otherwise, an error is raised.\n```ruby\nclass MyUploader < CarrierWave::Uploader::Base\n  def extension_whitelist\n    %w(jpg jpeg gif png)\n  end\nend\n```\nThe same thing could be done using content types.\nLet's say we need an uploader that accepts only images. This can be done like this\n```ruby\nclass MyUploader < CarrierWave::Uploader::Base\n  def content_type_whitelist\n    /image\\//\n  end\nend\n```\nYou can use a blacklist to reject content types.\nLet's say we need an uploader that reject JSON files. This can be done like this\n```ruby\nclass NoJsonUploader < CarrierWave::Uploader::Base\n  def content_type_blacklist\n    ['application/text', 'application/json']\n  end\nend\n```\n### Filenames and unicode chars\nAnother security issue you should care for is the file names (see\n[Ruby On Rails Security Guide](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/security.html#file-uploads)).\nBy default, CarrierWave provides only English letters, arabic numerals and some symbols as\nwhite-listed characters in the file name. If you want to support local scripts (Cyrillic letters, letters with diacritics and so on), you\nhave to override `sanitize_regexp` method. It should return regular expression which would match\nall *non*-allowed symbols.\n```ruby\nCarrierWave::SanitizedFile.sanitize_regexp = /[^[:word:]\\.\\-\\+]/\n```\nAlso make sure that allowing non-latin characters won't cause a compatibility issue with a third-party\nplugins or client-side software.\n## Setting the content type\nAs of v0.11.0, the `mime-types` gem is a runtime dependency and the content type is set automatically.\nYou no longer need to do this manually.\n## Adding versions\nOften you'll want to add different versions of the same file. The classic example is image thumbnails. There is built in support for this*:\n*Note:* You must have Imagemagick and MiniMagick installed to do image resizing. MiniMagick is a Ruby interface for Imagemagick which is a C program. This is why MiniMagick fails on 'bundle install' without Imagemagick installed.\nSome documentation refers to RMagick instead of MiniMagick but MiniMagick is recommended.\nTo install Imagemagick on OSX with homebrew type the following:\n```\n$ brew install imagemagick\n```\n```ruby\nclass MyUploader < CarrierWave::Uploader::Base\n  include CarrierWave::MiniMagick\n  process resize_to_fit: [800, 800]\n  version :thumb do\n    process resize_to_fill: [200,200]\n  end\nend\n```\nWhen this uploader is used, an uploaded image would be scaled to be no larger\nthan 800 by 800 pixels. The original aspect ratio will be kept.\nA version called thumb is then created, which is scaled\nto exactly 200 by 200 pixels.\nIf you would like to crop images to a specific height and width you\ncan use the alternative option of '''resize_to_fill'''. It will make sure\nthat the width and height specified are filled, only cropping\nif the aspect ratio requires it.\nThe uploader could be used like this:\n```ruby\nuploader = AvatarUploader.new\nuploader.store!(my_file)                              # size: 1024x768\nuploader.url # => '/url/to/my_file.png'               # size: 800x800\nuploader.thumb.url # => '/url/to/thumb_my_file.png'   # size: 200x200\n```\nOne important thing to remember is that process is called *before* versions are\ncreated. This can cut down on processing cost.\nIt is possible to nest versions within versions:\n```ruby\nclass MyUploader < CarrierWave::Uploader::Base\n  version :animal do\n    version :human\n    version :monkey\n    version :llama\n  end\nend\n```\n### Conditional versions\nOccasionally you want to restrict the creation of versions on certain\nproperties within the model or based on the picture itself.\n```ruby\nclass MyUploader < CarrierWave::Uploader::Base\n  version :human, if: :is_human?\n  version :monkey, if: :is_monkey?\n  version :banner, if: :is_landscape?\nprivate\n  def is_human? picture\n    model.can_program?(:ruby)\n  end\n  def is_monkey? picture\n    model.favorite_food == 'banana'\n  end\n  def is_landscape? picture\n    image = MiniMagick::Image.open(picture.path)\n    image[:width] > image[:height]\n  end\nend\n```\nThe `model` variable points to the instance object the uploader is attached to.\n### Create versions from existing versions\nFor performance reasons, it is often useful to create versions from existing ones\ninstead of using the original file. If your uploader generates several versions\nwhere the next is smaller than the last, it will take less time to generate from\na smaller, already processed image.\n```ruby\nclass MyUploader < CarrierWave::Uploader::Base\n  version :thumb do\n    process resize_to_fill: [280, 280]\n  end\n  version :small_thumb, from_version: :thumb do\n    process resize_to_fill: [20, 20]\n  end\nend\n```\nThe option `:from_version` uses the file cached in the `:thumb` version instead\nof the original version, potentially resulting in faster processing.\n## Making uploads work across form redisplays\nOften you'll notice that uploaded files disappear when a validation fails.\nCarrierWave has a feature that makes it easy to remember the uploaded file even\nin that case. Suppose your `user` model has an uploader mounted on `avatar`\nfile, just add a hidden field called `avatar_cache` (don't forget to add it to\nthe attr_accessible list as necessary). In Rails, this would look like this:\n```erb\n<%= form_for @user, html: { multipart: true } do |f| %>\n  <p>\n    <label>My Avatar</label>\n    <%= f.file_field :avatar %>\n    <%= f.hidden_field :avatar_cache %>\n  </p>\n<% end %>\n````\nIt might be a good idea to show the user that a file has been uploaded, in the\ncase of images, a small thumbnail would be a good indicator:\n```erb\n<%= form_for @user, html: { multipart: true } do |f| %>\n  <p>\n    <label>My Avatar</label>\n    <%= image_tag(@user.avatar_url) if @user.avatar? %>\n    <%= f.file_field :avatar %>\n    <%= f.hidden_field :avatar_cache %>\n  </p>\n<% end %>\n```\n## Removing uploaded files\nIf you want to remove a previously uploaded file on a mounted uploader, you can\neasily add a checkbox to the form which will remove the file when checked.\n```erb\n<%= form_for @user, html: { multipart: true } do |f| %>\n  <p>\n    <label>My Avatar</label>\n    <%= image_tag(@user.avatar_url) if @user.avatar? %>\n    <%= f.file_field :avatar %>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <label>\n      <%= f.check_box :remove_avatar %>\n      Remove avatar\n    </label>\n  </p>\n<% end %>\n```\nIf you want to remove the file manually, you can call <code>remove_avatar!</code>, then save the object.\n```erb\n@user.remove_avatar!\n@user.save\n#=> true\n```\n## Uploading files from a remote location\nYour users may find it convenient to upload a file from a location on the Internet\nvia a URL. CarrierWave makes this simple, just add the appropriate attribute to your\nform and you're good to go:\n```erb\n<%= form_for @user, html: { multipart: true } do |f| %>\n  <p>\n    <label>My Avatar URL:</label>\n    <%= image_tag(@user.avatar_url) if @user.avatar? %>\n    <%= f.text_field :remote_avatar_url %>\n  </p>\n<% end %>\n```\nIf you're using ActiveRecord, CarrierWave will indicate invalid URLs and download\nfailures automatically with attribute validation errors. If you aren't, or you\ndisable CarrierWave's `validate_download` option, you'll need to handle those\nerrors yourself.\n## Providing a default URL\nIn many cases, especially when working with images, it might be a good idea to\nprovide a default url, a fallback in case no file has been uploaded. You can do\nthis easily by overriding the `default_url` method in your uploader:\n```ruby\nclass MyUploader < CarrierWave::Uploader::Base\n  def default_url(*args)\n    \"/images/fallback/\" + [version_name, \"default.png\"].compact.join('_')\n  end\nend\n```\nOr if you are using the Rails asset pipeline:\n```ruby\nclass MyUploader < CarrierWave::Uploader::Base\n  def default_url(*args)\n    ActionController::Base.helpers.asset_path(\"fallback/\" + [version_name, \"default.png\"].compact.join('_'))\n  end\nend\n```\n## Recreating versions\nYou might come to a situation where you want to retroactively change a version\nor add a new one. You can use the `recreate_versions!` method to recreate the\nversions from the base file. This uses a naive approach which will re-upload and\nprocess the specified version or all versions, if none is passed as an argument.\nWhen you are generating random unique filenames you have to call `save!` on\nthe model after using `recreate_versions!`. This is necessary because\n`recreate_versions!` doesn't save the new filename to the database. Calling\n`save!` yourself will prevent that the database and file system are running\nout of sync.\n```ruby\ninstance = MyUploader.new\ninstance.recreate_versions!(:thumb, :large)\n```\nOr on a mounted uploader:\n```ruby\nUser.find_each do |user|\n  user.avatar.recreate_versions!\nend\n```\nNote: `recreate_versions!` will throw an exception on records without an image. To avoid this, scope the records to those with images or check if an image exists within the block. If you're using ActiveRecord, recreating versions for a user avatar might look like this:\n```ruby\nUser.find_each do |user|\n  user.avatar.recreate_versions! if user.avatar?\nend\n```\n## Configuring CarrierWave\nCarrierWave has a broad range of configuration options, which you can configure,\nboth globally and on a per-uploader basis:\n```ruby\nCarrierWave.configure do |config|\n  config.permissions = 0666\n  config.directory_permissions = 0777\n  config.storage = :file\nend\n```\nOr alternatively:\n```ruby\nclass AvatarUploader < CarrierWave::Uploader::Base\n  permissions 0777\nend\n```\nIf you're using Rails, create an initializer for this:\n\tconfig/initializers/carrierwave.rb\nIf you want CarrierWave to fail noisily in development, you can change these configs in your environment file:\n```ruby\nCarrierWave.configure do |config|\n  config.ignore_integrity_errors = false\n  config.ignore_processing_errors = false\n  config.ignore_download_errors = false\nend\n```\n## Testing with CarrierWave\nIt's a good idea to test your uploaders in isolation. In order to speed up your\ntests, it's recommended to switch off processing in your tests, and to use the\nfile storage. In Rails you could do that by adding an initializer with:\n```ruby\nif Rails.env.test? or Rails.env.cucumber?\n  CarrierWave.configure do |config|\n    config.storage = :file\n    config.enable_processing = false\n  end\nend\n```\nRemember, if you have already set `storage :something` in your uploader, the `storage`\nsetting from this initializer will be ignored.\nIf you need to test your processing, you should test it in isolation, and enable\nprocessing only for those tests that need it.\nCarrierWave comes with some RSpec matchers which you may find useful:\n```ruby\nrequire 'carrierwave/test/matchers'\ndescribe MyUploader do\n  include CarrierWave::Test::Matchers\n  let(:user) { double('user') }\n  let(:uploader) { MyUploader.new(user, :avatar) }\n  before do\n    MyUploader.enable_processing = true\n    File.open(path_to_file) { |f| uploader.store!(f) }\n  end\n  after do\n    MyUploader.enable_processing = false\n    uploader.remove!\n  end\n  context 'the thumb version' do\n    it \"scales down a landscape image to be exactly 64 by 64 pixels\" do\n      expect(uploader.thumb).to have_dimensions(64, 64)\n    end\n  end\n  context 'the small version' do\n    it \"scales down a landscape image to fit within 200 by 200 pixels\" do\n      expect(uploader.small).to be_no_larger_than(200, 200)\n    end\n  end\n  it \"makes the image readable only to the owner and not executable\" do\n    expect(uploader).to have_permissions(0600)\n  end\n  it \"has the correct format\" do\n    expect(uploader).to be_format('png')\n  end\nend\n```\nIf you're looking for minitest asserts, checkout [carrierwave_asserts](https://github.com/hcfairbanks/carrierwave_asserts).\nSetting the enable_processing flag on an uploader will prevent any of the versions from processing as well.\nProcessing can be enabled for a single version by setting the processing flag on the version like so:\n```ruby\n@uploader.thumb.enable_processing = true\n```\n## Fog\nIf you want to use fog you must add in your CarrierWave initializer the\nfollowing lines\n```ruby\nconfig.fog_provider = 'fog' # 'fog/aws' etc. Defaults to 'fog'\nconfig.fog_credentials = { ... } # Provider specific credentials\n```\n## Using Amazon S3\n[Fog AWS](http://github.com/fog/fog-aws) is used to support Amazon S3. Ensure you have it in your Gemfile:\n```ruby\ngem \"fog-aws\"\n```\nYou'll need to provide your fog_credentials and a fog_directory (also known as a bucket) in an initializer.\nFor the sake of performance it is assumed that the directory already exists, so please create it if it needs to be.\nYou can also pass in additional options, as documented fully in lib/carrierwave/storage/fog.rb. Here's a full example:\n```ruby\nCarrierWave.configure do |config|\n  config.fog_provider = 'fog/aws'                        # required\n  config.fog_credentials = {\n    provider:              'AWS',                        # required\n    aws_access_key_id:     'xxx',                        # required unless using use_iam_profile\n    aws_secret_access_key: 'yyy',                        # required unless using use_iam_profile\n    use_iam_profile:       true,                         # optional, defaults to false\n    region:                'eu-west-1',                  # optional, defaults to 'us-east-1'\n    host:                  's3.example.com',             # optional, defaults to nil\n    endpoint:              'https://s3.example.com:8080' # optional, defaults to nil\n  }\n  config.fog_directory  = 'name_of_bucket'                                      # required\n  config.fog_public     = false                                                 # optional, defaults to true\n  config.fog_attributes = { cache_control: \"public, max-age=#{365.days.to_i}\" } # optional, defaults to {}\nend\n```\nIn your uploader, set the storage to :fog\n```ruby\nclass AvatarUploader < CarrierWave::Uploader::Base\n  storage :fog\nend\n```\nThat's it! You can still use the `CarrierWave::Uploader#url` method to return the url to the file on Amazon S3.\n## Using Rackspace Cloud Files\n[Fog](http://github.com/fog/fog) is used to support Rackspace Cloud Files. Ensure you have it in your Gemfile:\n```ruby\ngem \"fog\"\n```\nYou'll need to configure a directory (also known as a container), username and API key in the initializer.\nFor the sake of performance it is assumed that the directory already exists, so please create it if need be.\nUsing a US-based account:\n```ruby\nCarrierWave.configure do |config|\n  config.fog_provider = \"fog/rackspace/storage\"   # optional, defaults to \"fog\"\n  config.fog_credentials = {\n    provider:           'Rackspace',\n    rackspace_username: 'xxxxxx',\n    rackspace_api_key:  'yyyyyy',\n    rackspace_region:   :ord                      # optional, defaults to :dfw\n  }\n  config.fog_directory = 'name_of_directory'\nend\n```\nUsing a UK-based account:\n```ruby\nCarrierWave.configure do |config|\n  config.fog_provider = \"fog/rackspace/storage\"   # optional, defaults to \"fog\"\n  config.fog_credentials = {\n    provider:           'Rackspace',\n    rackspace_username: 'xxxxxx',\n    rackspace_api_key:  'yyyyyy',\n    rackspace_auth_url: Fog::Rackspace::UK_AUTH_ENDPOINT,\n    rackspace_region:   :lon\n  }\n  config.fog_directory = 'name_of_directory'\nend\n```\nYou can optionally include your CDN host name in the configuration.\nThis is *highly* recommended, as without it every request requires a lookup\nof this information.\n```ruby\nconfig.asset_host = \"http://c000000.cdn.rackspacecloud.com\"\n```\nIn your uploader, set the storage to :fog\n```ruby\nclass AvatarUploader < CarrierWave::Uploader::Base\n  storage :fog\nend\n```\nThat's it! You can still use the `CarrierWave::Uploader#url` method to return\nthe url to the file on Rackspace Cloud Files.\n## Using Google Storage for Developers\n[Fog](http://github.com/fog/fog-google) is used to support Google Storage for Developers. Ensure you have it in your Gemfile:\n```ruby\ngem \"fog-google\"\ngem \"google-api-client\", \"> 0.8.5\", \"< 0.9\"\ngem \"mime-types\"\n```\nYou'll need to configure a directory (also known as a bucket), access key id and secret access key in the initializer.\nFor the sake of performance it is assumed that the directory already exists, so please create it if need be.\nPlease read the [fog-google README](https://github.com/fog/fog-google/blob/master/README.md) on how to get credentials.\n```ruby\nCarrierWave.configure do |config|\n  config.fog_provider = 'fog/google'                        # required\n  config.fog_credentials = {\n    provider:                         'Google',\n    google_storage_access_key_id:     'xxxxxx',\n    google_storage_secret_access_key: 'yyyyyy'\n  }\n  config.fog_directory = 'name_of_directory'\nend\n```\nIn your uploader, set the storage to :fog\n```ruby\nclass AvatarUploader < CarrierWave::Uploader::Base\n  storage :fog\nend\n```\nThat's it! You can still use the `CarrierWave::Uploader#url` method to return\nthe url to the file on Google.\n## Optimized Loading of Fog\nSince Carrierwave doesn't know which parts of Fog you intend to use, it will just load the entire library (unless you use e.g. [`fog-aws`, `fog-google`] instead of fog proper). If you prefer to load fewer classes into your application, you need to load those parts of Fog yourself *before* loading CarrierWave in your Gemfile.  Ex:\n```ruby\ngem \"fog\", \"~> 1.27\", require: \"fog/rackspace/storage\"\ngem \"carrierwave\"\n```\nA couple of notes about versions:\n* This functionality was introduced in Fog v1.20.\n* This functionality is slated for CarrierWave v1.0.0.\nIf you're not relying on Gemfile entries alone and are requiring \"carrierwave\" anywhere, ensure you require \"fog/rackspace/storage\" before it.  Ex:\n```ruby\nrequire \"fog/rackspace/storage\"\nrequire \"carrierwave\"\n```\nBeware that this specific require is only needed when working with a fog provider that was not extracted to its own gem yet.\nA list of the extracted providers can be found in the page of the `fog` organizations [here](https://github.com/fog).\nWhen in doubt, inspect `Fog.constants` to see what has been loaded.\n## Dynamic Asset Host\nThe `asset_host` config property can be assigned a proc (or anything that responds to `call`) for generating the host dynamically. The proc-compliant object gets an instance of the current `CarrierWave::Storage::Fog::File` or `CarrierWave::SanitizedFile` as its only argument.\n```ruby\nCarrierWave.configure do |config|\n  config.asset_host = proc do |file|\n    identifier = # some logic\n    \"http://#{identifier}.cdn.rackspacecloud.com\"\n  end\nend\n```\n## Using RMagick\nIf you're uploading images, you'll probably want to manipulate them in some way,\nyou might want to create thumbnail images for example. CarrierWave comes with a\nsmall library to make manipulating images with RMagick easier, you'll need to\ninclude it in your Uploader:\n```ruby\nclass AvatarUploader < CarrierWave::Uploader::Base\n  include CarrierWave::RMagick\nend\n```\nThe RMagick module gives you a few methods, like\n`CarrierWave::RMagick#resize_to_fill` which manipulate the image file in some\nway. You can set a `process` callback, which will call that method any time a\nfile is uploaded.\nThere is a demonstration of convert here.\nConvert will only work if the file has the same file extension, thus the use of the filename method.\n```ruby\nclass AvatarUploader < CarrierWave::Uploader::Base\n  include CarrierWave::RMagick\n  process resize_to_fill: [200, 200]\n  process convert: 'png'\n  def filename\n    super.chomp(File.extname(super)) + '.png' if original_filename.present?\n  end\nend\n```\nCheck out the manipulate! method, which makes it easy for you to write your own\nmanipulation methods.\n## Using MiniMagick\nMiniMagick is similar to RMagick but performs all the operations using the 'mogrify'\ncommand which is part of the standard ImageMagick kit. This allows you to have the power\nof ImageMagick without having to worry about installing all the RMagick libraries.\nSee the MiniMagick site for more details:\nhttps://github.com/minimagick/minimagick\nAnd the ImageMagick command line options for more for whats on offer:\nhttp://www.imagemagick.org/script/command-line-options.php\nCurrently, the MiniMagick carrierwave processor provides exactly the same methods as\nfor the RMagick processor.\n```ruby\nclass AvatarUploader < CarrierWave::Uploader::Base\n  include CarrierWave::MiniMagick\n  process resize_to_fill: [200, 200]\nend\n```\n## Migrating from Paperclip\nIf you are using Paperclip, you can use the provided compatibility module:\n```ruby\nclass AvatarUploader < CarrierWave::Uploader::Base\n  include CarrierWave::Compatibility::Paperclip\nend\n```\nSee the documentation for `CarrierWave::Compatibility::Paperclip` for more\ndetails.\nBe sure to use mount_on to specify the correct column:\n```ruby\nmount_uploader :avatar, AvatarUploader, mount_on: :avatar_file_name\n```\n## I18n\nThe Active Record validations use the Rails `i18n` framework. Add these keys to\nyour translations file:\n```yaml\nerrors:\n  messages:\n    carrierwave_processing_error: failed to be processed\n    carrierwave_integrity_error: is not of an allowed file type\n    carrierwave_download_error: could not be downloaded\n    extension_whitelist_error: \"You are not allowed to upload %{extension} files, allowed types: %{allowed_types}\"\n    extension_blacklist_error: \"You are not allowed to upload %{extension} files, prohibited types: %{prohibited_types}\"\n    content_type_whitelist_error: \"You are not allowed to upload %{content_type} files, allowed types: %{allowed_types}\"\n    content_type_blacklist_error: \"You are not allowed to upload %{content_type} files\"\n    rmagick_processing_error: \"Failed to manipulate with rmagick, maybe it is not an image?\"\n    mini_magick_processing_error: \"Failed to manipulate with MiniMagick, maybe it is not an image? Original Error: %{e}\"\n    min_size_error: \"File size should be greater than %{min_size}\"\n    max_size_error: \"File size should be less than %{max_size}\"\n```\nThe [`carrierwave-i18n`](https://github.com/carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave-i18n)\nlibrary adds support for additional locales.\n## Large files\nBy default, CarrierWave copies an uploaded file twice, first copying the file into the cache, then\ncopying the file into the store.  For large files, this can be prohibitively time consuming.\nYou may change this behavior by overriding either or both of the `move_to_cache` and\n`move_to_store` methods:\n```ruby\nclass MyUploader < CarrierWave::Uploader::Base\n  def move_to_cache\n    true\n  end\n  def move_to_store\n    true\n  end\nend\n```\nWhen the `move_to_cache` and/or `move_to_store` methods return true, files will be moved (instead of copied) to the cache and store respectively.\nThis has only been tested with the local filesystem store.\n## Skipping ActiveRecord callbacks\nBy default, mounting an uploader into an ActiveRecord model will add a few\ncallbacks. For example, this code:\n```ruby\nclass User\n  mount_uploader :avatar, AvatarUploader\nend\n```\nWill add these callbacks:\n```ruby\nafter_save :store_avatar!\nbefore_save :write_avatar_identifier\nafter_commit :remove_avatar!, on: :destroy\nafter_commit :mark_remove_avatar_false, on: :update\nafter_save :store_previous_changes_for_avatar\nafter_commit :remove_previously_stored_avatar, on: :update\n```\nIf you want to skip any of these callbacks (eg. you want to keep the existing\navatar, even after uploading a new one), you can use ActiveRecordâs\n`skip_callback` method.\n```ruby\nclass User\n  mount_uploader :avatar, AvatarUploader\n  skip_callback :commit, :after, :remove_previously_stored_avatar\nend\n```\n## Contributing to CarrierWave\nSee [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n## License\nCopyright (c) 2008-2015 Jonas Nicklas\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n\"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND\nNONINFRINGEMENT.

Syntax is a set of rules that govern\nthe way letters and punctuation may be used in a language. For example, English\nsyntax dictates that proper nouns should start with a capital letter and that\nsentences should end with a period.\nSemantics are the rules by which meaning may be derived in a language. For\nexample, as you read a book you are able to make some sense of the particular\nway in which words on a page are combined to form thoughts and express ideas\nbecause you understand what the words themselves mean and you understand what\nthey mean collectively.\nComputers use a similar process when interpreting code. First, the code must be\nparsed into recognizable symbols or tokens. These tokens may then be passed to\nan interpreter which is responsible for forming actual instructions from them.\nCitrus is a pure Ruby library that allows you to perform both lexical analysis\nand semantic interpretation quickly and easily. Using Citrus you can write\npowerful parsers that are simple to understand and easy to create and maintain.\nIn Citrus, there are three main types of objects: rules, grammars, and matches.\n## Rules\nA [Rule](http://mjackson.github.io/citrus/api/classes/Citrus/Rule.html) is an object\nthat specifies some matching behavior on a string. There are two types of rules:\nterminals and non-terminals. Terminals can be either Ruby strings or regular\nexpressions that specify some input to match. For example, a terminal created\nfrom the string \"end\" would match any sequence of the characters \"e\", \"n\", and\n\"d\", in that order. Terminals created from regular expressions may match any\nsequence of characters that can be generated from that expression.\nNon-terminals are rules that may contain other rules but do not themselves match\ndirectly on the input. For example, a Repeat is a non-terminal that may contain\none other rule that will try and match a certain number of times. Several other\ntypes of non-terminals are available that will be discussed later.\nRule objects may also have semantic information associated with them in the form\nof Ruby modules. Rules use these modules to extend the matches they create.\n## Grammars\nA [Grammar](http://mjackson.github.io/citrus/api/classes/Citrus/Grammar.html) is a\ncontainer for rules. Usually the rules in a grammar collectively form a complete\nspecification for some language, or a well-defined subset thereof.\nA Citrus grammar is really just a souped-up Ruby\n[module](http://ruby-doc.org/core/classes/Module.html). These modules may be\nincluded in other grammar modules in the same way that Ruby modules are normally\nused. This property allows you to divide a complex grammar into more manageable,\nreusable pieces that may be combined at runtime. Any rule with the same name as\na rule in an included grammar may access that rule with a mechanism similar to\nRuby's `super` keyword.\n## Matches\nA [Match](http://mjackson.github.io/citrus/api/classes/Citrus/Match.html) object\nrepresents a successful recognition of some piece of the input. Matches are\ncreated by rule objects during a parse.\nMatches are arranged in a tree structure where any match may contain any number\nof other matches. Each match contains information about its own subtree. The\nstructure of the tree is determined by the way in which the rule that generated\neach match is used in the grammar. For example, a match that is created from a\nnonterminal rule that contains several other terminals will likewise contain\nseveral matches, one for each terminal. However, this is an implementation\ndetail and should be relatively transparent to the user.\nMatch objects may be extended with semantic information in the form of methods.\nThese methods should provide various interpretations for the semantic value of a\nmatch.\n# Syntax\nThe most straightforward way to compose a Citrus grammar is to use Citrus' own\ncustom grammar syntax. This syntax borrows heavily from Ruby, so it should\nalready be familiar to Ruby programmers.\n## Terminals\nTerminals may be represented by a string or a regular expression. Both follow\nthe same rules as Ruby string and regular expression literals.\n    'abc'         # match \"abc\"\n    \"abc\\n\"       # match \"abc\\n\"\n    /abc/i        # match \"abc\" in any case\n    /\\xFF/        # match \"\\xFF\"\nCharacter classes and the dot (match anything) symbol are supported as well for\ncompatibility with other parsing expression implementations.\n    [a-z0-9]      # match any lowercase letter or digit\n    [\\x00-\\xFF]   # match any octet\n    .             # match any single character, including new lines\nAlso, strings may use backticks instead of quotes to indicate that they should\nmatch in a case-insensitive manner.\n    `abc`         # match \"abc\" in any case\nBesides case sensitivity, case-insensitive strings have the same behavior as\ndouble quoted strings.\nSee [Terminal](http://mjackson.github.io/citrus/api/classes/Citrus/Terminal.html) and\n[StringTerminal](http://mjackson.github.io/citrus/api/classes/Citrus/StringTerminal.html)\nfor more information.\n## Repetition\nQuantifiers may be used after any expression to specify a number of times it\nmust match. The universal form of a quantifier is `N*M` where `N` is the minimum\nand `M` is the maximum number of times the expression may match.\n    'abc'1*2      # match \"abc\" a minimum of one, maximum of two times\n    'abc'1*       # match \"abc\" at least once\n    'abc'*2       # match \"abc\" a maximum of twice\nAdditionally, the minimum and maximum may be omitted entirely to specify that an\nexpression may match zero or more times.\n    'abc'*        # match \"abc\" zero or more times\nThe `+` and `?` operators are supported as well for the common cases of `1*` and\n`*1` respectively.\n    'abc'+        # match \"abc\" one or more times\n    'abc'?        # match \"abc\" zero or one time\nSee [Repeat](http://mjackson.github.io/citrus/api/classes/Citrus/Repeat.html) for\nmore information.\n## Lookahead\nBoth positive and negative lookahead are supported in Citrus. Use the `&` and\n`!` operators to indicate that an expression either should or should not match.\nIn neither case is any input consumed.\n    'a' &'b'      # match an \"a\" that is followed by a \"b\"\n    'a' !'b'      # match an \"a\" that is not followed by a \"b\"\n    !'a' .        # match any character except for \"a\"\nA special form of lookahead is also supported which will match any character\nthat does not match a given expression.\n    ~'a'          # match all characters until an \"a\"\n    ~/xyz/        # match all characters until /xyz/ matches\nWhen using this operator (the tilde), at least one character must be consumed\nfor the rule to succeed.\nSee [AndPredicate](http://mjackson.github.io/citrus/api/classes/Citrus/AndPredicate.html),\n[NotPredicate](http://mjackson.github.io/citrus/api/classes/Citrus/NotPredicate.html),\nand [ButPredicate](http://mjackson.github.io/citrus/api/classes/Citrus/ButPredicate.html)\nfor more information.\n## Sequences\nSequences of expressions may be separated by a space to indicate that the rules\nshould match in that order.\n    'a' 'b' 'c'   # match \"a\", then \"b\", then \"c\"\n    'a' [0-9]     # match \"a\", then a numeric digit\nSee [Sequence](http://mjackson.github.io/citrus/api/classes/Citrus/Sequence.html)\nfor more information.\n## Choices\nOrdered choice is indicated by a vertical bar that separates two expressions.\nWhen using choice, each expression is tried in order. When one matches, the\nrule returns the match immediately without trying the remaining rules.\n    'a' | 'b'       # match \"a\" or \"b\"\n    'a' 'b' | 'c'   # match \"a\" then \"b\" (in sequence), or \"c\"\nIt is important to note when using ordered choice that any operator binds more\ntightly than the vertical bar. A full chart of operators and their respective\nlevels of precedence is below.\nSee [Choice](http://mjackson.github.io/citrus/api/classes/Citrus/Choice.html) for\nmore information.\n## Labels\nMatch objects may be referred to by a different name than the rule that\noriginally generated them. Labels are added by placing the label and a colon\nimmediately preceding any expression.\n    chars:/[a-z]+/  # the characters matched by the regular expression\n                    # may be referred to as \"chars\" in an extension\n                    # method\n## Extensions\nExtensions may be specified using either \"module\" or \"block\" syntax. When using\nmodule syntax, specify the name of a module that is used to extend match objects\nin between less than and greater than symbols.\n    [a-z0-9]5*9 <CouponCode>  # match a string that consists of any lower\n                              # cased letter or digit between 5 and 9\n                              # times and extend the match with the\n                              # CouponCode module\nAdditionally, extensions may be specified inline using curly braces. When using\nthis method, the code inside the curly braces may be invoked by calling the\n`value` method on the match object.\n    [0-9] { to_str.to_i }     # match any digit and return its integer value when\n                              # calling the #value method on the match object\nNote that when using the inline block method you may also specify arguments in\nbetween vertical bars immediately following the opening curly brace, just like\nin Ruby blocks.\n## Super\nWhen including a grammar inside another, all rules in the child that have the\nsame name as a rule in the parent also have access to the `super` keyword to\ninvoke the parent rule.\n    grammar Number\n      rule number\n        [0-9]+\n      end\n    end\n    grammar FloatingPoint\n      include Number\n      rule number\n        super ('.' super)?\n      end\n    end\nIn the example above, the `FloatingPoint` grammar includes `Number`. Both have a\nrule named `number`, so `FloatingPoint#number` has access to `Number#number` by\nmeans of using `super`.\nSee [Super](http://mjackson.github.io/citrus/api/classes/Citrus/Super.html) for more\ninformation.\n## Precedence\nThe following table contains a list of all Citrus symbols and operators and\ntheir precedence. A higher precedence indicates tighter binding.\nOperator                  | Name                      | Precedence\n------------------------- | ------------------------- | ----------\n`''`                      | String (single quoted)    | 7\n`\"\"`                      | String (double quoted)    | 7\n<code>``</code>           | String (case insensitive) | 7\n`[]`                      | Character class           | 7\n`.`                       | Dot (any character)       | 7\n`//`                      | Regular expression        | 7\n`()`                      | Grouping                  | 7\n`*`                       | Repetition (arbitrary)    | 6\n`+`                       | Repetition (one or more)  | 6\n`?`                       | Repetition (zero or one)  | 6\n`&`                       | And predicate             | 5\n`!`                       | Not predicate             | 5\n`~`                       | But predicate             | 5\n`<>`                      | Extension (module name)   | 4\n`{}`                      | Extension (literal)       | 4\n`:`                       | Label                     | 3\n`e1 e2`                   | Sequence                  | 2\n<code>e1 &#124; e2</code> | Ordered choice            | 1\n## Grouping\nAs is common in many programming languages, parentheses may be used to override\nthe normal binding order of operators. In the following example parentheses are\nused to make the vertical bar between `'b'` and `'c'` bind tighter than the\nspace between `'a'` and `'b'`.\n    'a' ('b' | 'c')   # match \"a\", then \"b\" or \"c\"\n# Example\nBelow is an example of a simple grammar that is able to parse strings of\nintegers separated by any amount of white space and a `+` symbol.\n    grammar Addition\n      rule additive\n        number plus (additive | number)\n      end\n      rule number\n        [0-9]+ space\n      end\n      rule plus\n        '+' space\n      end\n      rule space\n        [ \\t]*\n      end\n    end\nSeveral things to note about the above example:\n* Grammar and rule declarations end with the `end` keyword\n* A sequence of rules is created by separating expressions with a space\n* Likewise, ordered choice is represented with a vertical bar\n* Parentheses may be used to override the natural binding order\n* Rules may refer to other rules in their own definitions simply by using the\n  other rule's name\n* Any expression may be followed by a quantifier\n## Interpretation\nThe grammar above is able to parse simple mathematical expressions such as \"1+2\"\nand \"1 + 2+3\", but it does not have enough semantic information to be able to\nactually interpret these expressions.\nAt this point, when the grammar parses a string it generates a tree of\n[Match](http://mjackson.github.io/citrus/api/classes/Citrus/Match.html) objects.\nEach match is created by a rule and may itself be comprised of any number of\nsubmatches.\nSubmatches are created whenever a rule contains another rule. For example, in\nthe grammar above `number` matches a string of digits followed by white space.\nThus, a match generated by this rule will contain two submatches.\nWe can define a method inside a set of curly braces that will be used to extend\na particular rule's matches. This works in similar fashion to using Ruby's\nblocks. Let's extend the `Addition` grammar using this technique.\n    grammar Addition\n      rule additive\n        (number plus term:(additive | number)) {\n          capture(:number).value + capture(:term).value\n        }\n      end\n      rule number\n        ([0-9]+ space) {\n          to_str.to_i\n        }\n      end\n      rule plus\n        '+' space\n      end\n      rule space\n        [ \\t]*\n      end\n    end\nIn this version of the grammar we have added two semantic blocks, one each for\nthe `additive` and `number` rules. These blocks contain code that we can\nexecute by calling `value` on match objects that result from those rules. It's\neasiest to explain what is going on here by starting with the lowest level\nblock, which is defined within `number`.\nInside this block we see a call to another method, namely `to_str`. When called\nin the context of a match object, this method returns the match's internal\nstring object. Thus, the call to `to_str.to_i` should return the integer value\nof the match.\nSimilarly, matches created by `additive` will also have a `value` method. Notice\nthe use of the `term` label within the rule definition. This label allows the\nmatch that is created by the choice between `additive` and `number` to be\nretrieved using `capture(:term)`. The value of an additive match is determined\nto be the values of its `number` and `term` matches added together using Ruby's\naddition operator. Note that the plural form `captures(:term)` can be used to\nget an array of matches for a given label (e.g. when the label belongs to a\nrepetition).\nSince `additive` is the first rule defined in the grammar, any match that\nresults from parsing a string with this grammar will have a `value` method that\ncan be used to recursively calculate the collective value of the entire match\ntree.\nTo give it a try, save the code for the `Addition` grammar in a file called\naddition.citrus. Next, assuming you have the Citrus\n[gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/citrus) installed, try the following sequence of\ncommands in a terminal.\n    $ irb\n    > require 'citrus'\n     => true\n    > Citrus.load 'addition'\n     => [Addition]\n    > m = Addition.parse '1 + 2 + 3'\n     => #<Citrus::Match ...\n    > m.value\n     => 6\nCongratulations! You just ran your first piece of Citrus code.\nOne interesting thing to notice about the above sequence of commands is the\nreturn value of [Citrus#load](http://mjackson.github.io/citrus/api/classes/Citrus.html#M000003).\nWhen you use `Citrus.load` to load a grammar file (and likewise\n[Citrus#eval](http://mjackson.github.io/citrus/api/classes/Citrus.html#M000004) to\nevaluate a raw string of grammar code), the return value is an array of all the\ngrammars present in that file.\nTake a look at\n[calc.citrus](http://github.com/mjackson/citrus/blob/master/lib/citrus/grammars/calc.citrus)\nfor an example of a calculator that is able to parse and evaluate more complex\nmathematical expressions.\n## Additional Methods\nIf you need more than just a `value` method on your match object, you can attach\nadditional methods as well. There are two ways to do this. The first lets you\ndefine additional methods inline in your semantic block. This block will be used\nto create a new Module using [Module#new](http://ruby-doc.org/core/classes/Module.html#M001682).\nUsing the `Addition` example above, we might refactor the `additive` rule to\nlook like this:\n    rule additive\n      (number plus term:(additive | number)) {\n        def lhs\n          capture(:number).value\n        end\n        def rhs\n          capture(:term).value\n        end\n        def value\n          lhs + rhs\n        end\n      }\n    end\nNow, in addition to having a `value` method, matches that result from the\n`additive` rule will have a `lhs` and a `rhs` method as well. Although not\nparticularly useful in this example, this technique can be useful when unit\ntesting more complex rules. For example, using this method you might make the\nfollowing assertions in a unit test:\n    match = Addition.parse('1 + 4')\n    assert_equal(1, match.lhs)\n    assert_equal(4, match.rhs)\n    assert_equal(5, match.value)\nIf you would like to abstract away the code in a semantic block, simply create\na separate Ruby module (in another file) that contains the extension methods you\nwant and use the angle bracket notation to indicate that a rule should use that\nmodule when extending matches.\nTo demonstrate this method with the above example, in a Ruby file you would\ndefine the following module.\n    module Additive\n      def lhs\n        capture(:number).value\n      end\n      def rhs\n        capture(:term).value\n      end\n      def value\n        lhs + rhs\n      end\n    end\nThen, in your Citrus grammar file the rule definition would look like this:\n      rule additive\n        (number plus term:(additive | number)) <Additive>\n      end\nThis method of defining extensions can help keep your grammar files cleaner.\nHowever, you do need to make sure that your extension modules are already loaded\nbefore using `Citrus.load` to load your grammar file.\n# Testing\nCitrus was designed to facilitate simple and powerful testing of grammars. To\ndemonstrate how this is to be done, we'll use the `Addition` grammar from our\nprevious [example](example.html). The following code demonstrates a simple test\ncase that could be used to test that our grammar works properly.\n    class AdditionTest < Test::Unit::TestCase\n      def test_additive\n        match = Addition.parse('23 + 12', :root => :additive)\n        assert(match)\n        assert_equal('23 + 12', match)\n        assert_equal(35, match.value)\n      end\n      def test_number\n        match = Addition.parse('23', :root => :number)\n        assert(match)\n        assert_equal('23', match)\n        assert_equal(23, match.value)\n      end\n    end\nThe key here is using the `:root` option when performing the parse to specify\nthe name of the rule at which the parse should start. In `test_number`, since\n`:number` was given the parse will start at that rule as if it were the root\nrule of the entire grammar. The ability to change the root rule on the fly like\nthis enables easy unit testing of the entire grammar.\nAlso note that because match objects are themselves strings, assertions may be\nmade to test equality of match objects with string values.\n## Debugging\nWhen a parse fails, a [ParseError](http://mjackson.github.io/citrus/api/classes/Citrus/ParseError.html)\nobject is generated which provides a wealth of information about exactly where\nthe parse failed including the offset, line number, line text, and line offset.\nUsing this object, you could possibly provide some useful feedback to the user\nabout why the input was bad. The following code demonstrates one way to do this.\n    def parse_some_stuff(stuff)\n      match = StuffGrammar.parse(stuff)\n    rescue Citrus::ParseError => e\n      raise ArgumentError, \"Invalid stuff on line %d, offset %d!\" %\n        [e.line_number, e.line_offset]\n    end\nIn addition to useful error objects, Citrus also includes a means of visualizing\nmatch trees in the console via `Match#dump`. This can help when determining\nwhich rules are generating which matches and how they are organized in the\nmatch tree.\n# Extras\nSeveral files are included in the Citrus repository that make it easier to work\nwith grammar files in various editors.\n## TextMate\nTo install the Citrus [TextMate](http://macromates.com/) bundle, simply\ndouble-click on the `Citrus.tmbundle` file in the `extras` directory.\n## Vim\nTo install the [Vim](http://www.vim.org/) scripts, copy the files in\n`extras/vim` to a directory in Vim's\n[runtimepath](http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/options.html#\\'runtimepath\\').\n# Examples\nThe project source directory contains several example scripts that demonstrate\nhow grammars are to be constructed and used. Each Citrus file in the examples\ndirectory has an accompanying Ruby file that contains a suite of tests for that\nparticular file.\nThe best way to run any of these examples is to pass the name of the Ruby file\ndirectly to the Ruby interpreter on the command line, e.g.:\n    $ ruby -Ilib examples/calc_test.rb\nThis particular invocation uses the `-I` flag to ensure that you are using the\nversion of Citrus that was bundled with that particular example file (i.e. the\nversion that is contained in the `lib` directory).\n# Links\nDiscussion around Citrus happens on the [citrus-users Google group](http://groups.google.com/group/citrus-users).\nThe primary resource for all things to do with parsing expressions can be found\non the original [Packrat and Parsing Expression Grammars page](http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/~baford/packrat)\nat MIT.\nAlso, a useful summary of parsing expression grammars can be found on\n[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing_expression_grammar).\nCitrus draws inspiration from another Ruby library for writing parsing\nexpression grammars, Treetop. While Citrus' syntax is similar to that of\n[Treetop](http://treetop.rubyforge.org), it's not identical. The link is\nincluded here for those who may wish to explore an alternative implementation.\n# License\nCopyright 2010-2011 Michael Jackson\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\nThe software is provided \"as is\", without warranty of any kind, express or\nimplied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability,\nfitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement.

Works in Node.js and web browsers.\n## Installation\n```bash\n$ npm install debug\n```\n## Usage\n`debug` exposes a function; simply pass this function the name of your module, and it will return a decorated version of `console.error` for you to pass debug statements to. This will allow you to toggle the debug output for different parts of your module as well as the module as a whole.\nExample [_app.js_](./examples/node/app.js):\n```js\nvar debug = require('debug')('http')\n  , http = require('http')\n  , name = 'My App';\n// fake app\ndebug('booting %o', name);\nhttp.createServer(function(req, res){\n  debug(req.method + ' ' + req.url);\n  res.end('hello\\n');\n}).listen(3000, function(){\n  debug('listening');\n});\n// fake worker of some kind\nrequire('./worker');\n```\nExample [_worker.js_](./examples/node/worker.js):\n```js\nvar a = require('debug')('worker:a')\n  , b = require('debug')('worker:b');\nfunction work() {\n  a('doing lots of uninteresting work');\n  setTimeout(work, Math.random() * 1000);\n}\nwork();\nfunction workb() {\n  b('doing some work');\n  setTimeout(workb, Math.random() * 2000);\n}\nworkb();\n```\nThe `DEBUG` environment variable is then used to enable these based on space or\ncomma-delimited names.\nHere are some examples:\n<img width=\"647\" alt=\"screen shot 2017-08-08 at 12 53 04 pm\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71256/29091703-a6302cdc-7c38-11e7-8304-7c0b3bc600cd.png\">\n<img width=\"647\" alt=\"screen shot 2017-08-08 at 12 53 38 pm\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71256/29091700-a62a6888-7c38-11e7-800b-db911291ca2b.png\">\n<img width=\"647\" alt=\"screen shot 2017-08-08 at 12 53 25 pm\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71256/29091701-a62ea114-7c38-11e7-826a-2692bedca740.png\">\n#### Windows command prompt notes\n##### CMD\nOn Windows the environment variable is set using the `set` command.\n```cmd\nset DEBUG=*,-not_this\n```\nExample:\n```cmd\nset DEBUG=* & node app.js\n```\n##### PowerShell (VS Code default)\nPowerShell uses different syntax to set environment variables.\n```cmd\n$env:DEBUG = \"*,-not_this\"\n```\nExample:\n```cmd\n$env:DEBUG='app';node app.js\n```\nThen, run the program to be debugged as usual.\nnpm script example:\n```js\n  \"windowsDebug\": \"@powershell -Command $env:DEBUG='*';node app.js\",\n```\n## Namespace Colors\nEvery debug instance has a color generated for it based on its namespace name.\nThis helps when visually parsing the debug output to identify which debug instance\na debug line belongs to.\n#### Node.js\nIn Node.js, colors are enabled when stderr is a TTY. You also _should_ install\nthe [`supports-color`](https://npmjs.org/supports-color) module alongside debug,\notherwise debug will only use a small handful of basic colors.\n<img width=\"521\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71256/29092181-47f6a9e6-7c3a-11e7-9a14-1928d8a711cd.png\">\n#### Web Browser\nColors are also enabled on \"Web Inspectors\" that understand the `%c` formatting\noption. These are WebKit web inspectors, Firefox ([since version\n31](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2014/05/editable-box-model-multiple-selection-sublime-text-keys-much-more-firefox-developer-tools-episode-31/))\nand the Firebug plugin for Firefox (any version).\n<img width=\"524\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71256/29092033-b65f9f2e-7c39-11e7-8e32-f6f0d8e865c1.png\">\n## Millisecond diff\nWhen actively developing an application it can be useful to see when the time spent between one `debug()` call and the next. Suppose for example you invoke `debug()` before requesting a resource, and after as well, the \"+NNNms\" will show you how much time was spent between calls.\n<img width=\"647\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71256/29091486-fa38524c-7c37-11e7-895f-e7ec8e1039b6.png\">\nWhen stdout is not a TTY, `Date#toISOString()` is used, making it more useful for logging the debug information as shown below:\n<img width=\"647\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71256/29091956-6bd78372-7c39-11e7-8c55-c948396d6edd.png\">\n## Conventions\nIf you're using this in one or more of your libraries, you _should_ use the name of your library so that developers may toggle debugging as desired without guessing names. If you have more than one debuggers you _should_ prefix them with your library name and use \":\" to separate features. For example \"bodyParser\" from Connect would then be \"connect:bodyParser\".  If you append a \"*\" to the end of your name, it will always be enabled regardless of the setting of the DEBUG environment variable.  You can then use it for normal output as well as debug output.\n## Wildcards\nThe `*` character may be used as a wildcard. Suppose for example your library has\ndebuggers named \"connect:bodyParser\", \"connect:compress\", \"connect:session\",\ninstead of listing all three with\n`DEBUG=connect:bodyParser,connect:compress,connect:session`, you may simply do\n`DEBUG=connect:*`, or to run everything using this module simply use `DEBUG=*`.\nYou can also exclude specific debuggers by prefixing them with a \"-\" character.\nFor example, `DEBUG=*,-connect:*` would include all debuggers except those\nstarting with \"connect:\".\n## Environment Variables\nWhen running through Node.js, you can set a few environment variables that will\nchange the behavior of the debug logging:\n| Name      | Purpose                                         |\n|-----------|-------------------------------------------------|\n| `DEBUG`   | Enables/disables specific debugging namespaces. |\n| `DEBUG_HIDE_DATE` | Hide date from debug output (non-TTY).  |\n| `DEBUG_COLORS`| Whether or not to use colors in the debug output. |\n| `DEBUG_DEPTH` | Object inspection depth.                    |\n| `DEBUG_SHOW_HIDDEN` | Shows hidden properties on inspected objects. |\n__Note:__ The environment variables beginning with `DEBUG_` end up being\nconverted into an Options object that gets used with `%o`/`%O` formatters.\nSee the Node.js documentation for\n[`util.inspect()`](https://nodejs.org/api/util.html#util_util_inspect_object_options)\nfor the complete list.\n## Formatters\nDebug uses [printf-style](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Printf_format_string) formatting.\nBelow are the officially supported formatters:\n| Formatter | Representation |\n|-----------|----------------|\n| `%O`      | Pretty-print an Object on multiple lines. |\n| `%o`      | Pretty-print an Object all on a single line. |\n| `%s`      | String. |\n| `%d`      | Number (both integer and float). |\n| `%j`      | JSON. Replaced with the string '[Circular]' if the argument contains circular references. |\n| `%%`      | Single percent sign ('%'). This does not consume an argument. |\n### Custom formatters\nYou can add custom formatters by extending the `debug.formatters` object.\nFor example, if you wanted to add support for rendering a Buffer as hex with\n`%h`, you could do something like:\n```js\nconst createDebug = require('debug')\ncreateDebug.formatters.h = (v) => {\n  return v.toString('hex')\n}\n// â¦elsewhere\nconst debug = createDebug('foo')\ndebug('this is hex: %h', new Buffer('hello world'))\n//   foo this is hex: 68656c6c6f20776f726c6421 +0ms\n```\n## Browser Support\nYou can build a browser-ready script using [browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify),\nor just use the [browserify-as-a-service](https://wzrd.in/) [build](https://wzrd.in/standalone/debug@latest),\nif you don't want to build it yourself.\nDebug's enable state is currently persisted by `localStorage`.\nConsider the situation shown below where you have `worker:a` and `worker:b`,\nand wish to debug both. You can enable this using `localStorage.debug`:\n```js\nlocalStorage.debug = 'worker:*'\n```\nAnd then refresh the page.\n```js\na = debug('worker:a');\nb = debug('worker:b');\nsetInterval(function(){\n  a('doing some work');\n}, 1000);\nsetInterval(function(){\n  b('doing some work');\n}, 1200);\n```\nIn Chromium-based web browsers (e.g. Brave, Chrome, and Electron), the JavaScript console willâby defaultâonly show messages logged by `debug` if the \"Verbose\" log level is _enabled_.\n<img width=\"647\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7143133/152083257-29034707-c42c-4959-8add-3cee850e6fcf.png\">\n## Output streams\n  By default `debug` will log to stderr, however this can be configured per-namespace by overriding the `log` method:\nExample [_stdout.js_](./examples/node/stdout.js):\n```js\nvar debug = require('debug');\nvar error = debug('app:error');\n// by default stderr is used\nerror('goes to stderr!');\nvar log = debug('app:log');\n// set this namespace to log via console.log\nlog.log = console.log.bind(console); // don't forget to bind to console!\nlog('goes to stdout');\nerror('still goes to stderr!');\n// set all output to go via console.info\n// overrides all per-namespace log settings\ndebug.log = console.info.bind(console);\nerror('now goes to stdout via console.info');\nlog('still goes to stdout, but via console.info now');\n```\n## Extend\nYou can simply extend debugger \n```js\nconst log = require('debug')('auth');\n//creates new debug instance with extended namespace\nconst logSign = log.extend('sign');\nconst logLogin = log.extend('login');\nlog('hello'); // auth hello\nlogSign('hello'); //auth:sign hello\nlogLogin('hello'); //auth:login hello\n```\n## Set dynamically\nYou can also enable debug dynamically by calling the `enable()` method :\n```js\nlet debug = require('debug');\nconsole.log(1, debug.enabled('test'));\ndebug.enable('test');\nconsole.log(2, debug.enabled('test'));\ndebug.disable();\nconsole.log(3, debug.enabled('test'));\n```\nprint :   \n```\n1 false\n2 true\n3 false\n```\nUsage :  \n`enable(namespaces)`  \n`namespaces` can include modes separated by a colon and wildcards.\n   \nNote that calling `enable()` completely overrides previously set DEBUG variable : \n```\n$ DEBUG=foo node -e 'var dbg = require(\"debug\"); dbg.enable(\"bar\"); console.log(dbg.enabled(\"foo\"))'\n=> false\n```\n`disable()`\nWill disable all namespaces. The functions returns the namespaces currently\nenabled (and skipped). This can be useful if you want to disable debugging\ntemporarily without knowing what was enabled to begin with.\nFor example:\n```js\nlet debug = require('debug');\ndebug.enable('foo:*,-foo:bar');\nlet namespaces = debug.disable();\ndebug.enable(namespaces);\n```\nNote: There is no guarantee that the string will be identical to the initial\nenable string, but semantically they will be identical.\n## Checking whether a debug target is enabled\nAfter you've created a debug instance, you can determine whether or not it is\nenabled by checking the `enabled` property:\n```javascript\nconst debug = require('debug')('http');\nif (debug.enabled) {\n  // do stuff...\n}\n```\nYou can also manually toggle this property to force the debug instance to be\nenabled or disabled.\n## Usage in child processes\nDue to the way `debug` detects if the output is a TTY or not, colors are not shown in child processes when `stderr` is piped. A solution is to pass the `DEBUG_COLORS=1` environment variable to the child process.  \nFor example:\n```javascript\nworker = fork(WORKER_WRAP_PATH, [workerPath], {\n  stdio: [\n    /* stdin: */ 0,\n    /* stdout: */ 'pipe',\n    /* stderr: */ 'pipe',\n    'ipc',\n  ],\n  env: Object.assign({}, process.env, {\n    DEBUG_COLORS: 1 // without this settings, colors won't be shown\n  }),\n});\nworker.stderr.pipe(process.stderr, { end: false });\n```\n## Authors\n - TJ Holowaychuk\n - Nathan Rajlich\n - Andrew Rhyne\n - Josh Junon\n## Backers\nSupport us with a monthly donation and help us continue our activities.

Works in Node.js and web browsers.\n## Installation\n```bash\n$ npm install debug\n```\n## Usage\n`debug` exposes a function; simply pass this function the name of your module, and it will return a decorated version of `console.error` for you to pass debug statements to. This will allow you to toggle the debug output for different parts of your module as well as the module as a whole.\nExample [_app.js_](./examples/node/app.js):\n```js\nvar debug = require('debug')('http')\n  , http = require('http')\n  , name = 'My App';\n// fake app\ndebug('booting %o', name);\nhttp.createServer(function(req, res){\n  debug(req.method + ' ' + req.url);\n  res.end('hello\\n');\n}).listen(3000, function(){\n  debug('listening');\n});\n// fake worker of some kind\nrequire('./worker');\n```\nExample [_worker.js_](./examples/node/worker.js):\n```js\nvar a = require('debug')('worker:a')\n  , b = require('debug')('worker:b');\nfunction work() {\n  a('doing lots of uninteresting work');\n  setTimeout(work, Math.random() * 1000);\n}\nwork();\nfunction workb() {\n  b('doing some work');\n  setTimeout(workb, Math.random() * 2000);\n}\nworkb();\n```\nThe `DEBUG` environment variable is then used to enable these based on space or\ncomma-delimited names.\nHere are some examples:\n<img width=\"647\" alt=\"screen shot 2017-08-08 at 12 53 04 pm\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71256/29091703-a6302cdc-7c38-11e7-8304-7c0b3bc600cd.png\">\n<img width=\"647\" alt=\"screen shot 2017-08-08 at 12 53 38 pm\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71256/29091700-a62a6888-7c38-11e7-800b-db911291ca2b.png\">\n<img width=\"647\" alt=\"screen shot 2017-08-08 at 12 53 25 pm\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71256/29091701-a62ea114-7c38-11e7-826a-2692bedca740.png\">\n#### Windows command prompt notes\n##### CMD\nOn Windows the environment variable is set using the `set` command.\n```cmd\nset DEBUG=*,-not_this\n```\nExample:\n```cmd\nset DEBUG=* & node app.js\n```\n##### PowerShell (VS Code default)\nPowerShell uses different syntax to set environment variables.\n```cmd\n$env:DEBUG = \"*,-not_this\"\n```\nExample:\n```cmd\n$env:DEBUG='app';node app.js\n```\nThen, run the program to be debugged as usual.\nnpm script example:\n```js\n  \"windowsDebug\": \"@powershell -Command $env:DEBUG='*';node app.js\",\n```\n## Namespace Colors\nEvery debug instance has a color generated for it based on its namespace name.\nThis helps when visually parsing the debug output to identify which debug instance\na debug line belongs to.\n#### Node.js\nIn Node.js, colors are enabled when stderr is a TTY. You also _should_ install\nthe [`supports-color`](https://npmjs.org/supports-color) module alongside debug,\notherwise debug will only use a small handful of basic colors.\n<img width=\"521\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71256/29092181-47f6a9e6-7c3a-11e7-9a14-1928d8a711cd.png\">\n#### Web Browser\nColors are also enabled on \"Web Inspectors\" that understand the `%c` formatting\noption. These are WebKit web inspectors, Firefox ([since version\n31](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2014/05/editable-box-model-multiple-selection-sublime-text-keys-much-more-firefox-developer-tools-episode-31/))\nand the Firebug plugin for Firefox (any version).\n<img width=\"524\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71256/29092033-b65f9f2e-7c39-11e7-8e32-f6f0d8e865c1.png\">\n## Millisecond diff\nWhen actively developing an application it can be useful to see when the time spent between one `debug()` call and the next. Suppose for example you invoke `debug()` before requesting a resource, and after as well, the \"+NNNms\" will show you how much time was spent between calls.\n<img width=\"647\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71256/29091486-fa38524c-7c37-11e7-895f-e7ec8e1039b6.png\">\nWhen stdout is not a TTY, `Date#toISOString()` is used, making it more useful for logging the debug information as shown below:\n<img width=\"647\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71256/29091956-6bd78372-7c39-11e7-8c55-c948396d6edd.png\">\n## Conventions\nIf you're using this in one or more of your libraries, you _should_ use the name of your library so that developers may toggle debugging as desired without guessing names. If you have more than one debuggers you _should_ prefix them with your library name and use \":\" to separate features. For example \"bodyParser\" from Connect would then be \"connect:bodyParser\".  If you append a \"*\" to the end of your name, it will always be enabled regardless of the setting of the DEBUG environment variable.  You can then use it for normal output as well as debug output.\n## Wildcards\nThe `*` character may be used as a wildcard. Suppose for example your library has\ndebuggers named \"connect:bodyParser\", \"connect:compress\", \"connect:session\",\ninstead of listing all three with\n`DEBUG=connect:bodyParser,connect:compress,connect:session`, you may simply do\n`DEBUG=connect:*`, or to run everything using this module simply use `DEBUG=*`.\nYou can also exclude specific debuggers by prefixing them with a \"-\" character.\nFor example, `DEBUG=*,-connect:*` would include all debuggers except those\nstarting with \"connect:\".\n## Environment Variables\nWhen running through Node.js, you can set a few environment variables that will\nchange the behavior of the debug logging:\n| Name      | Purpose                                         |\n|-----------|-------------------------------------------------|\n| `DEBUG`   | Enables/disables specific debugging namespaces. |\n| `DEBUG_HIDE_DATE` | Hide date from debug output (non-TTY).  |\n| `DEBUG_COLORS`| Whether or not to use colors in the debug output. |\n| `DEBUG_DEPTH` | Object inspection depth.                    |\n| `DEBUG_SHOW_HIDDEN` | Shows hidden properties on inspected objects. |\n__Note:__ The environment variables beginning with `DEBUG_` end up being\nconverted into an Options object that gets used with `%o`/`%O` formatters.\nSee the Node.js documentation for\n[`util.inspect()`](https://nodejs.org/api/util.html#util_util_inspect_object_options)\nfor the complete list.\n## Formatters\nDebug uses [printf-style](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Printf_format_string) formatting.\nBelow are the officially supported formatters:\n| Formatter | Representation |\n|-----------|----------------|\n| `%O`      | Pretty-print an Object on multiple lines. |\n| `%o`      | Pretty-print an Object all on a single line. |\n| `%s`      | String. |\n| `%d`      | Number (both integer and float). |\n| `%j`      | JSON. Replaced with the string '[Circular]' if the argument contains circular references. |\n| `%%`      | Single percent sign ('%'). This does not consume an argument. |\n### Custom formatters\nYou can add custom formatters by extending the `debug.formatters` object.\nFor example, if you wanted to add support for rendering a Buffer as hex with\n`%h`, you could do something like:\n```js\nconst createDebug = require('debug')\ncreateDebug.formatters.h = (v) => {\n  return v.toString('hex')\n}\n// â¦elsewhere\nconst debug = createDebug('foo')\ndebug('this is hex: %h', new Buffer('hello world'))\n//   foo this is hex: 68656c6c6f20776f726c6421 +0ms\n```\n## Browser Support\nYou can build a browser-ready script using [browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify),\nor just use the [browserify-as-a-service](https://wzrd.in/) [build](https://wzrd.in/standalone/debug@latest),\nif you don't want to build it yourself.\nDebug's enable state is currently persisted by `localStorage`.\nConsider the situation shown below where you have `worker:a` and `worker:b`,\nand wish to debug both. You can enable this using `localStorage.debug`:\n```js\nlocalStorage.debug = 'worker:*'\n```\nAnd then refresh the page.\n```js\na = debug('worker:a');\nb = debug('worker:b');\nsetInterval(function(){\n  a('doing some work');\n}, 1000);\nsetInterval(function(){\n  b('doing some work');\n}, 1200);\n```\nIn Chromium-based web browsers (e.g. Brave, Chrome, and Electron), the JavaScript console willâby defaultâonly show messages logged by `debug` if the \"Verbose\" log level is _enabled_.\n<img width=\"647\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7143133/152083257-29034707-c42c-4959-8add-3cee850e6fcf.png\">\n## Output streams\n  By default `debug` will log to stderr, however this can be configured per-namespace by overriding the `log` method:\nExample [_stdout.js_](./examples/node/stdout.js):\n```js\nvar debug = require('debug');\nvar error = debug('app:error');\n// by default stderr is used\nerror('goes to stderr!');\nvar log = debug('app:log');\n// set this namespace to log via console.log\nlog.log = console.log.bind(console); // don't forget to bind to console!\nlog('goes to stdout');\nerror('still goes to stderr!');\n// set all output to go via console.info\n// overrides all per-namespace log settings\ndebug.log = console.info.bind(console);\nerror('now goes to stdout via console.info');\nlog('still goes to stdout, but via console.info now');\n```\n## Extend\nYou can simply extend debugger \n```js\nconst log = require('debug')('auth');\n//creates new debug instance with extended namespace\nconst logSign = log.extend('sign');\nconst logLogin = log.extend('login');\nlog('hello'); // auth hello\nlogSign('hello'); //auth:sign hello\nlogLogin('hello'); //auth:login hello\n```\n## Set dynamically\nYou can also enable debug dynamically by calling the `enable()` method :\n```js\nlet debug = require('debug');\nconsole.log(1, debug.enabled('test'));\ndebug.enable('test');\nconsole.log(2, debug.enabled('test'));\ndebug.disable();\nconsole.log(3, debug.enabled('test'));\n```\nprint :   \n```\n1 false\n2 true\n3 false\n```\nUsage :  \n`enable(namespaces)`  \n`namespaces` can include modes separated by a colon and wildcards.\n   \nNote that calling `enable()` completely overrides previously set DEBUG variable : \n```\n$ DEBUG=foo node -e 'var dbg = require(\"debug\"); dbg.enable(\"bar\"); console.log(dbg.enabled(\"foo\"))'\n=> false\n```\n`disable()`\nWill disable all namespaces. The functions returns the namespaces currently\nenabled (and skipped). This can be useful if you want to disable debugging\ntemporarily without knowing what was enabled to begin with.\nFor example:\n```js\nlet debug = require('debug');\ndebug.enable('foo:*,-foo:bar');\nlet namespaces = debug.disable();\ndebug.enable(namespaces);\n```\nNote: There is no guarantee that the string will be identical to the initial\nenable string, but semantically they will be identical.\n## Checking whether a debug target is enabled\nAfter you've created a debug instance, you can determine whether or not it is\nenabled by checking the `enabled` property:\n```javascript\nconst debug = require('debug')('http');\nif (debug.enabled) {\n  // do stuff...\n}\n```\nYou can also manually toggle this property to force the debug instance to be\nenabled or disabled.\n## Usage in child processes\nDue to the way `debug` detects if the output is a TTY or not, colors are not shown in child processes when `stderr` is piped. A solution is to pass the `DEBUG_COLORS=1` environment variable to the child process.  \nFor example:\n```javascript\nworker = fork(WORKER_WRAP_PATH, [workerPath], {\n  stdio: [\n    /* stdin: */ 0,\n    /* stdout: */ 'pipe',\n    /* stderr: */ 'pipe',\n    'ipc',\n  ],\n  env: Object.assign({}, process.env, {\n    DEBUG_COLORS: 1 // without this settings, colors won't be shown\n  }),\n});\nworker.stderr.pipe(process.stderr, { end: false });\n```\n## Authors\n - TJ Holowaychuk\n - Nathan Rajlich\n - Andrew Rhyne\n - Josh Junon\n## Backers\nSupport us with a monthly donation and help us continue our activities.

Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n   agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n   Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n   PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n   of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\nAPPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n   To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n   boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n   replaced with your own identifying information.

The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was\napplied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any\nreason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such\npartial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder\nof the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she\nwill not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related\nRights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of\naction with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's\nexpress Statement of Purpose.\n4.

Create error hierarchies so `instanceof` becomes a useful tool in tracking errors. Call-stack is correctly captured at the time you create an instance of the error object, plus a `cause` property will make available the original error object if you pass one in to the constructor.\n```js\nvar create = require('errno').custom.createError\nvar MyError = create('MyError') // inherits from Error\nvar SpecificError = create('SpecificError', MyError) // inherits from MyError\nvar OtherError = create('OtherError', MyError)\n// use them!\nif (condition) throw new SpecificError('Eeek! Something bad happened')\nif (err) return callback(new OtherError(err))\n```\nAlso available is a `errno.custom.FilesystemError` with in-built access to errno properties:\n```js\nfs.readFile('foo', function (err, data) {\n  if (err) return callback(new errno.custom.FilesystemError(err))\n  // do something else\n})\n```\nThe resulting error object passed through the callback will have the following properties: `code`, `errno`, `path` and `message` will contain a descriptive human-readable message.\n## Contributors\n* [bahamas10](https://github.com/bahamas10) (Dave Eddy) - Added CLI\n* [ralphtheninja](https://github.com/ralphtheninja) (Lars-Magnus Skog)\n## Copyright & Licence\n*Copyright (c) 2012-2015 [Rod Vagg](https://github.com/rvagg) ([@rvagg](https://twitter.com/rvagg))*\nMade available under the MIT licence:\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished\nto do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

This will allow you to toggle the debug output for different parts of your module as well as the module as a whole.\nExample _app.js_:\n```js\nvar debug = require('debug')('http')\n  , http = require('http')\n  , name = 'My App';\n// fake app\ndebug('booting %s', name);\nhttp.createServer(function(req, res){\n  debug(req.method + ' ' + req.url);\n  res.end('hello\\n');\n}).listen(3000, function(){\n  debug('listening');\n});\n// fake worker of some kind\nrequire('./worker');\n```\nExample _worker.js_:\n```js\nvar debug = require('debug')('worker');\nsetInterval(function(){\n  debug('doing some work');\n}, 1000);\n```\n The __DEBUG__ environment variable is then used to enable these based on space or comma-delimited names. Here are some examples:\n  ![debug http and worker](http://f.cl.ly/items/18471z1H402O24072r1J/Screenshot.png)\n  ![debug worker](http://f.cl.ly/items/1X413v1a3M0d3C2c1E0i/Screenshot.png)\n#### Windows note\n On Windows the environment variable is set using the `set` command.\n ```cmd\n set DEBUG=*,-not_this\n ```\n Note that PowerShell uses different syntax to set environment variables.\n ```cmd\n $env:DEBUG = \"*,-not_this\"\n  ```\nThen, run the program to be debugged as usual.\n## Millisecond diff\n  When actively developing an application it can be useful to see when the time spent between one `debug()` call and the next. Suppose for example you invoke `debug()` before requesting a resource, and after as well, the \"+NNNms\" will show you how much time was spent between calls.\n  ![](http://f.cl.ly/items/2i3h1d3t121M2Z1A3Q0N/Screenshot.png)\n  When stdout is not a TTY, `Date#toUTCString()` is used, making it more useful for logging the debug information as shown below:\n  ![](http://f.cl.ly/items/112H3i0e0o0P0a2Q2r11/Screenshot.png)\n## Conventions\n  If you're using this in one or more of your libraries, you _should_ use the name of your library so that developers may toggle debugging as desired without guessing names. If you have more than one debuggers you _should_ prefix them with your library name and use \":\" to separate features. For example \"bodyParser\" from Connect would then be \"connect:bodyParser\".\n## Wildcards\n  The `*` character may be used as a wildcard. Suppose for example your library has debuggers named \"connect:bodyParser\", \"connect:compress\", \"connect:session\", instead of listing all three with `DEBUG=connect:bodyParser,connect:compress,connect:session`, you may simply do `DEBUG=connect:*`, or to run everything using this module simply use `DEBUG=*`.\n  You can also exclude specific debuggers by prefixing them with a \"-\" character.  For example, `DEBUG=*,-connect:*` would include all debuggers except those starting with \"connect:\".\n## Environment Variables\n  When running through Node.js, you can set a few environment variables that will\n  change the behavior of the debug logging:\n| Name      | Purpose                                         |\n|-----------|-------------------------------------------------|\n| `DEBUG`   | Enables/disables specific debugging namespaces. |\n| `DEBUG_COLORS`| Whether or not to use colors in the debug output. |\n| `DEBUG_DEPTH` | Object inspection depth. |\n| `DEBUG_SHOW_HIDDEN` | Shows hidden properties on inspected objects. |\n  __Note:__ The environment variables beginning with `DEBUG_` end up being\n  converted into an Options object that gets used with `%o`/`%O` formatters.\n  See the Node.js documentation for\n  [`util.inspect()`](https://nodejs.org/api/util.html#util_util_inspect_object_options)\n  for the complete list.\n## Formatters\n  Debug uses [printf-style](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Printf_format_string) formatting. Below are the officially supported formatters:\n| Formatter | Representation |\n|-----------|----------------|\n| `%O`      | Pretty-print an Object on multiple lines. |\n| `%o`      | Pretty-print an Object all on a single line. |\n| `%s`      | String. |\n| `%d`      | Number (both integer and float). |\n| `%j`      | JSON. Replaced with the string '[Circular]' if the argument contains circular references. |\n| `%%`      | Single percent sign ('%'). This does not consume an argument. |\n### Custom formatters\n  You can add custom formatters by extending the `debug.formatters` object. For example, if you wanted to add support for rendering a Buffer as hex with `%h`, you could do something like:\n```js\nconst createDebug = require('debug')\ncreateDebug.formatters.h = (v) => {\n  return v.toString('hex')\n}\n// â¦elsewhere\nconst debug = createDebug('foo')\ndebug('this is hex: %h', new Buffer('hello world'))\n//   foo this is hex: 68656c6c6f20776f726c6421 +0ms\n```\n## Browser support\n  You can build a browser-ready script using [browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify),\n  or just use the [browserify-as-a-service](https://wzrd.in/) [build](https://wzrd.in/standalone/debug@latest),\n  if you don't want to build it yourself.\n  Debug's enable state is currently persisted by `localStorage`.\n  Consider the situation shown below where you have `worker:a` and `worker:b`,\n  and wish to debug both. You can enable this using `localStorage.debug`:\n```js\nlocalStorage.debug = 'worker:*'\n```\nAnd then refresh the page.\n```js\na = debug('worker:a');\nb = debug('worker:b');\nsetInterval(function(){\n  a('doing some work');\n}, 1000);\nsetInterval(function(){\n  b('doing some work');\n}, 1200);\n```\n#### Web Inspector Colors\n  Colors are also enabled on \"Web Inspectors\" that understand the `%c` formatting\n  option. These are WebKit web inspectors, Firefox ([since version\n  31](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2014/05/editable-box-model-multiple-selection-sublime-text-keys-much-more-firefox-developer-tools-episode-31/))\n  and the Firebug plugin for Firefox (any version).\n  Colored output looks something like:\n  ![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/71256/3139768/b98c5fd8-e8ef-11e3-862a-f7253b6f47c6.png)\n## Output streams\n  By default `debug` will log to stderr, however this can be configured per-namespace by overriding the `log` method:\nExample _stdout.js_:\n```js\nvar debug = require('debug');\nvar error = debug('app:error');\n// by default stderr is used\nerror('goes to stderr!');\nvar log = debug('app:log');\n// set this namespace to log via console.log\nlog.log = console.log.bind(console); // don't forget to bind to console!\nlog('goes to stdout');\nerror('still goes to stderr!');\n// set all output to go via console.info\n// overrides all per-namespace log settings\ndebug.log = console.info.bind(console);\nerror('now goes to stdout via console.info');\nlog('still goes to stdout, but via console.info now');\n```\n## Authors\n - TJ Holowaychuk\n - Nathan Rajlich\n - Andrew Rhyne\n \n## Backers\nSupport us with a monthly donation and help us continue our activities.

By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n                            NO WARRANTY\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along\n    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,\n    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this\nwhen it starts in an interactive mode:\n    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author\n    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may\nbe called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be\nmouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\nnecessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\n  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program\n  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\n  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989\n  Ty Coon, President of Vice\nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\nproprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may\nconsider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the\nlibrary.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License.\nlibffi - Copyright (c) 1996-2020  Anthony Green, Red Hat, Inc and others.\nSee source files for details.\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n``Software''), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED ``AS IS'', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\nCopyright (c) 2008-2016, Ruby FFI project contributors\nAll rights reserved.\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\nmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n    * Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright\n      notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer.\n    * Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright\n      notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n      documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n    * Neither the name of the Ruby FFI project nor the\n      names of its contributors may be used to endorse or promote products\n      derived from this software without specific prior written permission.\nTHIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS \"AS IS\" AND\nANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED\nWARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE\nDISCLAIMED.

Conveying Modified Versions.\n  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a\nfacility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application\nthat uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the\nfacility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified\nversion:\n   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to\n   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the\n   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs\n   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\n   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of\n   this License applicable to that copy.\n  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.\n  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from\na header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object\ncode under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated\nmaterial is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure\nlayouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates\n(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the\n   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n  4. Combined Works.\n  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,\ntaken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the\nportions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of\nthe following:\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that\n   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during\n   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among\n   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the\n   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n   d) Do one of the following:\n       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this\n       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form\n       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to\n       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of\n       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the\n       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying\n       Corresponding Source.\n       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time\n       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer\n       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version\n       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked\n       Version.\n   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise\n   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the\n   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is\n   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the\n   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the\n   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If\n   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany\n   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application\n   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation\n   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL\n   for conveying Corresponding Source.)\n  5. Combined Libraries.\n  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side by side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this\nLicense, and convey such a combined library under terms of your\nchoice, if you do both of the following:\n   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based\n   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,\n   conveyed under the terms of this License.\n   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it\n   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the\n   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new\nversions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\ndiffer in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the\nLibrary as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License \"or any later version\"\napplies to it, you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that published version or of any later version\npublished by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you\nreceived it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide\nwhether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall\napply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is\npermanent authorization for you to choose that version for the\nLibrary.","notice":""},{"name":"gitlab_chronic_duration","version":"0.10.6.2","licenses":["MIT"],"texts":"Copyright (c) Henry Poydar\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person\nobtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation\nfiles (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without\nrestriction, including without limitation the rights to use,\ncopy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the\nSoftware is furnished to do so, subject to the following\nconditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES\nOF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND\nNONINFRINGEMENT.

But for many applications, you often donât have a full DN to identify the user. \n  You usually get a simple identifier like a username or an email address, along with a password. \n  Since many LDAP servers don't allow anonymous access, search function will require a bound connection, \n  `:bind_dn` and `:password` will be required for searching on the username or email to retrieve the DN attribute\n  for the user. If the LDAP server allows anonymous access, you don't need to provide these two parameters.\n- `:uid` is the LDAP attribute name for the user name in the login form.\n  typically AD would be 'sAMAccountName' or 'UserPrincipalName', while OpenLDAP is 'uid'.\n- `:filter` is the LDAP filter used to search the user entry. It can be used in place of :uid for more flexibility.\n  `%{username}` will be replaced by the user name processed by `:name_proc`.\n- `:name_proc` allows you to match the user name entered with the format of the :uid attributes.\n  For example, value of 'sAMAccountName' in AD contains only the windows user name. If your user prefers using \n  email to login, a name_proc as above will trim the email string down to just the windows login name. \n  In summary, use `:name_proc` to fill the gap between the submitted username and LDAP uid attribute value.\n \n- `:try_sasl` and `:sasl_mechanisms` are optional. `:try_sasl` [`true` | `false`], `:sasl_mechanisms` [`'DIGEST-MD5'` | `'GSS-SPNEGO'`]\n  Use them to initialize a SASL connection to server. If you are not familiar with these authentication methods, \n  please just avoid them.\n- `:tls_options` allows you to pass in OpenSSL options like `:ssl_version`,\n  `:ciphers` and more. See http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.0.0/libdoc/openssl/rdoc/OpenSSL/SSL/SSLContext.html\n  for all available options and values.\nDirect users to '/auth/ldap' to have them authenticated via your company's LDAP server.\n## License\nCopyright (C) 2011 by Ping Yu and Intridea, Inc.\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

After reviewing the options, I settled on using the `Accept: application/json;version=1` method [as outlined here](http://labs.qandidate.com/blog/2014/10/16/using-the-accept-header-to-version-your-api/).\nThe `version=1` part of the `media-type` is a `parameter` as defined by [RFC7231 Section 3.1.1.1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-3.1.1.1). After reviewing several existing different options for parsing the `Accept:` header, I noticed a disturbing trend: `header.split(',')`. Because parameters may contain quoted strings which contain commas, this is clearly not an appropriate way to parse the header.\nI am concerned about correctness, security and performance. As such, I implemented this gem to provide a simple high level interface for both parsing and correctly interpreting these headers.\n## Installation\nAdd this line to your application's Gemfile:\n```ruby\ngem 'http-accept'\n```\nAnd then execute:\n\t$ bundle\nOr install it yourself as:\n\t$ gem install http-accept\n## Usage\nHere are some examples of how to parse various headers.\n### Parsing Accept: headers\nYou can parse the incoming `Accept:` header:\n```ruby\nmedia_types = HTTP::Accept::MediaTypes.parse(\"text/html;q=0.5, application/json; version=1\")\nexpect(media_types[0].mime_type).to be == \"application/json\"\nexpect(media_types[0].parameters).to be == {'version' => '1'}\nexpect(media_types[1].mime_type).to be == \"text/html\"\nexpect(media_types[1].parameters).to be == {'q' => '0.5'}\n```\nNormally, you'd want to match the media types against some set of available mime types:\n```ruby\nmodule ToJSON\n  def content_type\n    HTTP::Accept::ContentType.new(\"application/json\", charset: 'utf-8')\n  end\n  # Used for inserting into map.\n  def split(*args)\n    content_type.split(*args)\n  end\n  def convert(object, options)\n    object.to_json\n  end\nend\nmodule ToXML\n  # Are you kidding?\nend\nmap = HTTP::Accept::MediaTypes::Map.new\nmap << ToJSON\nmap << ToXML\nobject, media_range = map.for(media_types)\ncontent = object.convert(model, media_range.parameters)\nresponse = [200, {'Content-Type' => object.content_type}, [content]]\n```\n### Parsing Accept-Language: headers\nYou can parse the incoming `Accept-Language:` header:\n```ruby\nlanguages = HTTP::Accept::Languages.parse(\"da, en-gb;q=0.8, en;q=0.7\")\nexpect(languages[0].locale).to be == \"da\"\nexpect(languages[1].locale).to be == \"en-gb\"\nexpect(languages[2].locale).to be == \"en\"\n```\nNormally, you'd want to match the languages against some set of available localizations:\n```ruby\navailable_localizations = HTTP::Accept::Languages::Locales.new([\"en-nz\", \"en-us\"])\n# Given the languages that the user wants, and the localizations available, compute the set of desired localizations.\ndesired_localizations = available_localizations & languages\n```\nThe `desired_localizations` in the example above is a subset of `available_localizations`.\n`HTTP::Accept::Languages::Locales` provides an efficient data-structure for matching the Accept-Languages header to set of available localizations according to https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-5.3.5 and https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4647#section-2.3\n## Contributing\n1.

In one case tested, using the incremental version was about 50% faster than concatenating 5-10 strings and then hashing.\nInstallation\n------------\nTo use iMurmurHash in the browser, [download the latest version](https://raw.github.com/jensyt/imurmurhash-js/master/imurmurhash.min.js) and include it as a script on your site.\n```html\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"/scripts/imurmurhash.min.js\"></script>\n<script>\n// Your code here, access iMurmurHash using the global object MurmurHash3\n</script>\n```\n---\nTo use iMurmurHash in Node.js, install the module using NPM:\n```bash\nnpm install imurmurhash\n```\nThen simply include it in your scripts:\n```javascript\nMurmurHash3 = require('imurmurhash');\n```\nQuick Example\n-------------\n```javascript\n// Create the initial hash\nvar hashState = MurmurHash3('string');\n// Incrementally add text\nhashState.hash('more strings');\nhashState.hash('even more strings');\n// All calls can be chained if desired\nhashState.hash('and').hash('some').hash('more');\n// Get a result\nhashState.result();\n// returns 0xe4ccfe6b\n```\nFunctions\n---------\n### MurmurHash3 ([string], [seed])\nGet a hash state object, optionally initialized with the given _string_ and _seed_. _Seed_ must be a positive integer if provided. Calling this function without the `new` keyword will return a cached state object that has been reset. This is safe to use as long as the object is only used from a single thread and no other hashes are created while operating on this one. If this constraint cannot be met, you can use `new` to create a new state object. For example:\n```javascript\n// Use the cached object, calling the function again will return the same\n// object (but reset, so the current state would be lost)\nhashState = MurmurHash3();\n...\n// Create a new object that can be safely used however you wish. Calling the\n// function again will simply return a new state object, and no state loss\n// will occur, at the cost of creating more objects.\nhashState = new MurmurHash3();\n```\nBoth methods can be mixed however you like if you have different use cases.\n---\n### MurmurHash3.prototype.hash (string)\nIncrementally add _string_ to the hash. This can be called as many times as you want for the hash state object, including after a call to `result()`. Returns `this` so calls can be chained.\n---\n### MurmurHash3.prototype.result ()\nGet the result of the hash as a 32-bit positive integer. This performs the tail and finalizer portions of the algorithm, but does not store the result in the state object. This means that it is perfectly safe to get results and then continue adding strings via `hash`.\n```javascript\n// Do the whole string at once\nMurmurHash3('this is a test string').result();\n// 0x70529328\n// Do part of the string, get a result, then the other part\nvar m = MurmurHash3('this is a');\nm.result();\n// 0xbfc4f834\nm.hash(' test string').result();\n// 0x70529328 (same as above)\n```\n---\n### MurmurHash3.prototype.reset ([seed])\nReset the state object for reuse, optionally using the given _seed_ (defaults to 0 like the constructor). Returns `this` so calls can be chained.\n---\nLicense (MIT)\n-------------\nCopyright (c) 2013 Gary Court, Jens Taylor\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\nthis software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of\nthe Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so,\nsubject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS\nFOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n  0. Definitions.\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n  1. Source Code.\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n  7. Additional Terms.\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n  8. Termination.\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n  11. Patents.\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS","notice":""},{"name":"jwt","version":"2.1.0","licenses":["MIT"],"texts":"# JWT\n[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/jwt.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/jwt)\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jwt/ruby-jwt.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/jwt/ruby-jwt)\n[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/jwt/ruby-jwt/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/jwt/ruby-jwt)\n[![Test Coverage](https://codeclimate.com/github/jwt/ruby-jwt/badges/coverage.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/jwt/ruby-jwt/coverage)\n[![Issue Count](https://codeclimate.com/github/jwt/ruby-jwt/badges/issue_count.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/jwt/ruby-jwt)\nA pure ruby implementation of the [RFC 7519 OAuth JSON Web Token (JWT)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519) standard.\nIf you have further questions related to development or usage, join us: [ruby-jwt google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ruby-jwt).\n## Announcements\n* Ruby 1.9.3 support was dropped at December 31st, 2016.\n* Version 1.5.3 yanked.

Currently the jwt gem supports NONE, HMAC, RSASSA and ECDSA. If you are using cryptographic signing, you need to specify the algorithm in the options hash whenever you call JWT.decode to ensure that an attacker [cannot bypass the algorithm verification step](https://auth0.com/blog/2015/03/31/critical-vulnerabilities-in-json-web-token-libraries/).\nSee: [ JSON Web Algorithms (JWA) 3.1. \"alg\" (Algorithm) Header Parameter Values for JWS](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7518#section-3.1)\n**NONE**\n* none - unsigned token\n```ruby\nrequire 'jwt'\npayload = {:data => 'test'}\n# IMPORTANT: set nil as password parameter\ntoken = JWT.encode payload, nil, 'none'\n# eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJub25lIn0.eyJkYXRhIjoidGVzdCJ9.\nputs token\n# Set password to nil and validation to false otherwise this won't work\ndecoded_token = JWT.decode token, nil, false\n# Array\n# [\n#   {\"data\"=>\"test\"}, # payload\n#   {\"alg\"=>\"none\"} # header\n# ]\nputs decoded_token\n```\n**HMAC**\n* HS256 - HMAC using SHA-256 hash algorithm\n* HS512256 - HMAC using SHA-512-256 hash algorithm (only available with RbNaCl; see note below)\n* HS384 - HMAC using SHA-384 hash algorithm\n* HS512 - HMAC using SHA-512 hash algorithm\n```ruby\nhmac_secret = 'my$ecretK3y'\ntoken = JWT.encode payload, hmac_secret, 'HS256'\n# eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJkYXRhIjoidGVzdCJ9.ZxW8go9hz3ETCSfxFxpwSkYg_602gOPKearsf6DsxgY\nputs token\ndecoded_token = JWT.decode token, hmac_secret, true, { :algorithm => 'HS256' }\n# Array\n# [\n#   {\"data\"=>\"test\"}, # payload\n#   {\"alg\"=>\"HS256\"} # header\n# ]\nputs decoded_token\n```\nNote: If [RbNaCl](https://github.com/cryptosphere/rbnacl) is loadable, ruby-jwt will use it for HMAC-SHA256, HMAC-SHA512-256, and HMAC-SHA512.

The processing of the `exp` claim requires that the current date/time MUST be before the expiration date/time listed in the `exp` claim. Implementers MAY provide for some small `leeway`, usually no more than a few minutes, to account for clock skew. Its value MUST be a number containing a ***NumericDate*** value. Use of this claim is OPTIONAL.\n**Handle Expiration Claim**\n```ruby\nexp = Time.now.to_i + 4 * 3600\nexp_payload = { :data => 'data', :exp => exp }\ntoken = JWT.encode exp_payload, hmac_secret, 'HS256'\nbegin\n  decoded_token = JWT.decode token, hmac_secret, true, { :algorithm => 'HS256' }\nrescue JWT::ExpiredSignature\n  # Handle expired token, e.g. logout user or deny access\nend\n```\n**Adding Leeway**\n```ruby\nexp = Time.now.to_i - 10\nleeway = 30 # seconds\nexp_payload = { :data => 'data', :exp => exp }\n# build expired token\ntoken = JWT.encode exp_payload, hmac_secret, 'HS256'\nbegin\n  # add leeway to ensure the token is still accepted\n  decoded_token = JWT.decode token, hmac_secret, true, { :exp_leeway => leeway, :algorithm => 'HS256' }\nrescue JWT::ExpiredSignature\n  # Handle expired token, e.g. logout user or deny access\nend\n```\n### Not Before Time Claim\nFrom [Oauth JSON Web Token 4.1.5. \"nbf\" (Not Before) Claim](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.5):\n> The `nbf` (not before) claim identifies the time before which the JWT MUST NOT be accepted for processing. The processing of the `nbf` claim requires that the current date/time MUST be after or equal to the not-before date/time listed in the `nbf` claim. Implementers MAY provide for some small `leeway`, usually no more than a few minutes, to account for clock skew. Its value MUST be a number containing a ***NumericDate*** value. Use of this claim is OPTIONAL.\n**Handle Not Before Claim**\n```ruby\nnbf = Time.now.to_i - 3600\nnbf_payload = { :data => 'data', :nbf => nbf }\ntoken = JWT.encode nbf_payload, hmac_secret, 'HS256'\nbegin\n  decoded_token = JWT.decode token, hmac_secret, true, { :algorithm => 'HS256' }\nrescue JWT::ImmatureSignature\n  # Handle invalid token, e.g. logout user or deny access\nend\n```\n**Adding Leeway**\n```ruby\nnbf = Time.now.to_i + 10\nleeway = 30\nnbf_payload = { :data => 'data', :nbf => nbf }\n# build expired token\ntoken = JWT.encode nbf_payload, hmac_secret, 'HS256'\nbegin\n  # add leeway to ensure the token is valid\n  decoded_token = JWT.decode token, hmac_secret, true, { :nbf_leeway => leeway, :algorithm => 'HS256' }\nrescue JWT::ImmatureSignature\n  # Handle invalid token, e.g. logout user or deny access\nend\n```\n### Issuer Claim\nFrom [Oauth JSON Web Token 4.1.1. \"iss\" (Issuer) Claim](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.1):\n> The `iss` (issuer) claim identifies the principal that issued the JWT. The processing of this claim is generally application specific. The `iss` value is a case-sensitive string containing a ***StringOrURI*** value. Use of this claim is OPTIONAL.\nYou can pass multiple allowed issuers as an Array, verification will pass if one of them matches the `iss` value in the payload.\n```ruby\niss = 'My Awesome Company Inc. or https://my.awesome.website/'\niss_payload = { :data => 'data', :iss => iss }\ntoken = JWT.encode iss_payload, hmac_secret, 'HS256'\nbegin\n  # Add iss to the validation to check if the token has been manipulated\n  decoded_token = JWT.decode token, hmac_secret, true, { :iss => iss, :verify_iss => true, :algorithm => 'HS256' }\nrescue JWT::InvalidIssuerError\n  # Handle invalid token, e.g. logout user or deny access\nend\n```\n### Audience Claim\nFrom [Oauth JSON Web Token 4.1.3. \"aud\" (Audience) Claim](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.3):\n> The `aud` (audience) claim identifies the recipients that the JWT is intended for. Each principal intended to process the JWT MUST identify itself with a value in the audience claim. If the principal processing the claim does not identify itself with a value in the `aud` claim when this claim is present, then the JWT MUST be rejected. In the general case, the `aud` value is an array of case-sensitive strings, each containing a ***StringOrURI*** value. In the special case when the JWT has one audience, the `aud` value MAY be a single case-sensitive string containing a ***StringOrURI*** value. The interpretation of audience values is generally application specific. Use of this claim is OPTIONAL.\n```ruby\naud = ['Young', 'Old']\naud_payload = { :data => 'data', :aud => aud }\ntoken = JWT.encode aud_payload, hmac_secret, 'HS256'\nbegin\n  # Add aud to the validation to check if the token has been manipulated\n  decoded_token = JWT.decode token, hmac_secret, true, { :aud => aud, :verify_aud => true, :algorithm => 'HS256' }\nrescue JWT::InvalidAudError\n  # Handle invalid token, e.g. logout user or deny access\n  puts 'Audience Error'\nend\n```\n### JWT ID Claim\nFrom [Oauth JSON Web Token 4.1.7. \"jti\" (JWT ID) Claim](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.7):\n> The `jti` (JWT ID) claim provides a unique identifier for the JWT. The identifier value MUST be assigned in a manner that ensures that there is a negligible probability that the same value will be accidentally assigned to a different data object; if the application uses multiple issuers, collisions MUST be prevented among values produced by different issuers as well. The `jti` claim can be used to prevent the JWT from being replayed. The `jti` value is a case-sensitive string. Use of this claim is OPTIONAL.\n```ruby\n# Use the secret and iat to create a unique key per request to prevent replay attacks\njti_raw = [hmac_secret, iat].join(':').to_s\njti = Digest::MD5.hexdigest(jti_raw)\njti_payload = { :data => 'data', :iat => iat, :jti => jti }\ntoken = JWT.encode jti_payload, hmac_secret, 'HS256'\nbegin\n  # If :verify_jti is true, validation will pass if a JTI is present\n  #decoded_token = JWT.decode token, hmac_secret, true, { :verify_jti => true, :algorithm => 'HS256' }\n  # Alternatively, pass a proc with your own code to check if the JTI has already been used\n  decoded_token = JWT.decode token, hmac_secret, true, { :verify_jti => proc { |jti| my_validation_method(jti) }, :algorithm => 'HS256' }\nrescue JWT::InvalidJtiError\n  # Handle invalid token, e.g. logout user or deny access\n  puts 'Error'\nend\n```\n### Issued At Claim\nFrom [Oauth JSON Web Token 4.1.6. \"iat\" (Issued At) Claim](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.6):\n> The `iat` (issued at) claim identifies the time at which the JWT was issued. This claim can be used to determine the age of the JWT. Its value MUST be a number containing a ***NumericDate*** value. Use of this claim is OPTIONAL.\n**Handle Issued At Claim**\n```ruby\niat = Time.now.to_i\niat_payload = { :data => 'data', :iat => iat }\ntoken = JWT.encode iat_payload, hmac_secret, 'HS256'\nbegin\n  # Add iat to the validation to check if the token has been manipulated\n  decoded_token = JWT.decode token, hmac_secret, true, { :verify_iat => true, :algorithm => 'HS256' }\nrescue JWT::InvalidIatError\n  # Handle invalid token, e.g. logout user or deny access\nend\n```\n**Adding Leeway**\n```ruby\niat = Time.now.to_i + 10\nleeway = 30 # seconds\niat_payload = { :data => 'data', :iat => iat }\n# build token issued in the future\ntoken = JWT.encode iat_payload, hmac_secret, 'HS256'\nbegin\n  # add leeway to ensure the token is accepted\n  decoded_token = JWT.decode token, hmac_secret, true, { :iat_leeway => leeway, :verify_iat => true, :algorithm => 'HS256' }\nrescue JWT::InvalidIatError\n  # Handle invalid token, e.g. logout user or deny access\nend\n```\n### Subject Claim\nFrom [Oauth JSON Web Token 4.1.2. \"sub\" (Subject) Claim](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.2):\n> The `sub` (subject) claim identifies the principal that is the subject of the JWT. The Claims in a JWT are normally statements about the subject. The subject value MUST either be scoped to be locally unique in the context of the issuer or be globally unique. The processing of this claim is generally application specific. The sub value is a case-sensitive string containing a ***StringOrURI*** value. Use of this claim is OPTIONAL.\n```ruby\nsub = 'Subject'\nsub_payload = { :data => 'data', :sub => sub }\ntoken = JWT.encode sub_payload, hmac_secret, 'HS256'\nbegin\n  # Add sub to the validation to check if the token has been manipulated\n  decoded_token = JWT.decode token, hmac_secret, true, { 'sub' => sub, :verify_sub => true, :algorithm => 'HS256' }\nrescue JWT::InvalidSubError\n  # Handle invalid token, e.g. logout user or deny access\nend\n```\n# Development and Tests\nWe depend on [Bundler](http://rubygems.org/gems/bundler) for defining gemspec and performing releases to rubygems.org, which can be done with\n```bash\nrake release\n```\nThe tests are written with rspec. Given you have installed the dependencies via bundler, you can run tests with\n```bash\nbundle exec rspec\n```\n**If you want a release cut with your PR, please include a version bump according to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/)**\n## Contributors\n * Jordan Brough <github.jordanb@xoxy.net>\n * Ilya Zhitomirskiy <ilya@joindiaspora.com>\n * Daniel Grippi <daniel@joindiaspora.com>\n * Jeff Lindsay <progrium@gmail.com>\n * Bob Aman <bob@sporkmonger.com>\n * Micah Gates <github@mgates.com>\n * Rob Wygand <rob@wygand.com>\n * Ariel Salomon (Oscil8)\n * Paul Battley <pbattley@gmail.com>\n * Zane Shannon [@zshannon](https://github.com/zshannon)\n * Brian Fletcher [@punkle](https://github.com/punkle)\n * Alex [@ZhangHanDong](https://github.com/ZhangHanDong)\n * John Downey [@jtdowney](https://github.com/jtdowney)\n * Adam Greene [@skippy](https://github.com/skippy)\n * Tim Rudat [@excpt](https://github.com/excpt) <timrudat@gmail.com> - Maintainer\n## License\nMIT\nCopyright (c) 2011 Jeff Lindsay\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

If you have an older\nversion of Ruby installed, you can update via Homebrew:\n```sh\n$ ruby -e \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)\"\n```\nthen:\n```sh\n$ brew install ruby\n```\nThe easiest way to use `license_finder` is to install it as a command\nline tool, like brew, awk, gem or bundler:\n```sh\n$ gem install license_finder\n```\nThough it's less preferable, if you are using bundler in a Ruby\nproject, you can add `license_finder` to your Gemfile:\n```ruby\ngem 'license_finder', :group => :development\n```\nThis approach helps you remember to install `license_finder`, but can\npull in unwanted dependencies, including `bundler`. To mitigate this\nproblem, see [Excluding Dependencies](#excluding-dependencies).\n## Usage\nMake sure your dependencies are installed (with your package manager's install command: `bundle install`, `npm install`, etc.)\nThe first time you run `license_finder` it will list all your project's packages.\n```sh\n$ license_finder\n```\nOr, if you installed with bundler:\n```sh\n$ bundle exec license_finder\n```\nThe output will report that none of your packages have been\napproved.  Over time you will tell `license_finder` which packages\nare approved, so when you run this command in the future, it will\nreport current action items; i.e., packages that are new or have\nnever been approved.\nIf you don't wish to see progressive output \"dots\", use the `--quiet`\noption.\nIf you'd like to see debugging output, use the `--debug`\noption. `license_finder` will then output info about packages, their\ndependencies, and where and how each license was discovered. This can\nbe useful when you need to track down an unexpected package or\nlicense.\nIf you do not want to manually run an individual package manager's prepare\ncommand (ex: `bundle install`, `npm install`, etc) to ensure your project\nis fully prepared to be scanned, use the `--prepare` or `-p` option which will run\neach active package manager's prepare command for you. If you would like to continue\nrunning `license_finder` even if there is an issue with a prepare step, use the\n`--prepare-no-fail` option which prepares but carries on despite any potential failures.\nRun `license_finder help` to see other available commands, and\n`license_finder help [COMMAND]` for detailed help on a specific\ncommand.\n### Docker\nIf you have docker installed, try using the included `dlf` script (potentially\nsymlinked to be in your path via `ln -s LicenseFinder/dlf /usr/local/bin` or\nwhatever method you prefer). This will run any commands passed to it inside a\npre-provisioned Docker container to maintain consistent versions of all the\npackage managers. For example,\n```\n$ dlf npm --version\n5.3.0\n$ dlf license_finder --help\nDependencies that need approval:\n...\nlicense_finder, 3.0.3, MIT\n$ dlf \"bundle install && license_finder\"\n```\nYou can better understand the way this script works by looking at its source, but for\nreference it will mount your current directory at the path `/scan` and run any commands\npassed to it from that directory.\nNote that the docker image will run the gem which is installed within it.\nSo the docker image tagged `7.0.0` will run *License Finder Version 7.0.0*\nSee the [contributing guide](https://github.com/pivotal/LicenseFinder/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for information on development. \n### Activation\n`license_finder` will find and include packages for all supported\nlanguages, as long as that language has a package definition in the project directory:\n* `Gemfile` (for `bundler`)\n* `requirements.txt` (for `pip`)\n* `Pipfile.lock` (for `pipenv`)\n* `package.json` (for `npm`)\n* `pom.xml` (for `maven`)\n* `build.gradle` or `build.gradle.kts` (for `gradle`)\n* `settings.gradle` that specifies `rootProject.buildFileName` (for `gradle`)\n* `bower.json` (for `bower`)\n* `Podfile` (for `pod`) (set `ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS_PATH` variable if you want to target a particular `Pods-acknowledgements-<TARGET>.plist`. Can be useful in multi-target pods projects.)\n* `Cartfile` (for `carthage`)\n* `workspace-state.json` under build directory (provided as enviroment variable `SPM_DERIVED_DATA` for Xcode, or default `.build` for non-Xcode projects), (for `spm`)\n* `rebar.config` (for `rebar`)\n* `Erlang.mk` or `erlang.mk` file (for `Erlang.mk`)\n* `mix.exs` (for `mix`)\n* `packages/` directory (for `nuget`)\n* `*.csproj` (for `dotnet`)\n* `vendor/manifest` or `*/vendor/manifest` file (for `gvt`)\n* `glide.lock` file (for `glide`)\n* `vendor/vendor.json` file (for `govendor`)\n* `Gopkg.lock` file (for `dep`)\n* `Godeps/Godeps.json` (for `godep`)\n* `*.envrc` file (for `go`) \n* `go.mod` file (for `go mod`)\n* `vendor.conf` file (for `trash`)\n* `yarn.lock` file (for `yarn`)\n* `conanfile.txt` file (for `conan`)\n* `build.sbt` file (for `sbt`)\n* `Cargo.lock` file (for `cargo`)\n* `composer.lock` file (for `composer`)\n* `environment,yml` file (for `conda`)\n* `pubspec.yaml & .pub cache locaton through ENV variable` (for `flutter`)\n### Continuous Integration\n`license_finder` will return a non-zero exit status if there are unapproved\ndependencies. This can be useful for inclusion in a CI environment to alert you\nif someone adds an unapproved dependency to the project.\n## Approving Dependencies\n`license_finder` will inform you whenever you have an unapproved dependency.\nIf your business decides this is an acceptable risk, the easiest way to approve\nthe dependency is by running `license_finder approvals add`.\nFor example, let's assume you've added the `awesome_gpl_gem`\nto your Gemfile, which `license_finder` reports is unapproved:\n```sh\n$ license_finder\nDependencies that need approval:\nawesome_gpl_gem, 1.0.0, GPL\n```\nYour business tells you that in this case, it's acceptable to use this\ngem. You now run:\n```sh\n$ license_finder approvals add awesome_gpl_gem\n```\nIf you rerun `license_finder`, you should no longer see\n`awesome_gpl_gem` in the output.\nTo approve specific version\n```sh\n$ license_finder approvals add awesome_gpl_gem --version=1.0.0\n```\nTo record who approved the dependency and why:\n```sh\n$ license_finder approvals add awesome_gpl_gem --who CTO --why \"Go ahead\"\n```\n### Permitting Licenses\nApproving packages one-by-one can be tedious.  Usually your business has\nblanket policies about which packages are approved.  To tell `license_finder`\nthat any package with the MIT license should be approved, run:\n``` sh\n$ license_finder permitted_licenses add MIT\n```\nAny current or future packages with the MIT license will be excluded from the\noutput of `license_finder`.\nYou can also record `--who` and `--why` when changing permitted licenses,\nor making any other decision about your project.\n## Output and Artifacts\n### Decisions file\nAny decisions you make about approvals will be recorded in a YAML file named\n`doc/dependency_decisions.yml`.\nThis file must be committed to version control.  Rarely, you will have to\nmanually resolve conflicts in it.  In this situation, keep in mind that each\ndecision has an associated timestamp, and the decisions are processed\ntop-to-bottom, with later decisions overwriting or appending to earlier\ndecisions.\n### Output from `action_items`\nYou could expect `license_finder`, which is an alias for `license_finder\naction_items` to output something like the following on a Rails project where\nMIT had been permitted:\n```\nDependencies that need approval:\nhighline, 1.6.14, ruby\njson, 1.7.5, ruby\nmime-types, 1.19, ruby\nrails, 3.2.8, unknown\nrdoc, 3.12, unknown\nrubyzip, 0.9.9, ruby\nxml-simple, 1.1.1, unknown\n```\nYou can customize the format of the output in the same way that you customize\n[output from `report`](#output-from-report).\n### Output from `project_roots`\nThe `license_finder project_roots` command will output the current working directory as a string in an array.\nUsing the `--recursive` option means the array will include subdirectories that contain a known package manager. With the exception that Gradle and Maven subprojects will not be included.\n### Output from `report`\nThe `license_finder report` command will output human-readable reports that you\ncould send to your non-technical business partners, lawyers, etc.  You can\nchoose the format of the report (text, csv, html or markdown); see\n`license_finder --help report` for details.  The output is sent to STDOUT, so\nyou can save the reports wherever you want them.  You can commit them to\nversion control if you like.\nThe HTML report generated by `license_finder report --format html` summarizes\nall of your project's dependencies and includes information about which need to\nbe approved. The project name at the top of the report can be set with\n`license_finder project_name add`.\n### Note:\nWhen using the yarn package manager, when a node_module's package.json doesn't\nexplicitly declare a license, yarn indicates that it has inferred the license based\non some keywords in other files by appending an asterisk to the license name. If you\nsee a * at the end of the license name, this is intended.\nSee [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/pivotal/LicenseFinder/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#adding-reports)\nfor advice about adding and customizing reports.\n## Manual Intervention\n### Setting Licenses\nWhen `license_finder` reports that a dependency's license is 'unknown',\nyou should manually research what the actual license is.  When you\nhave established the real license, you can record it with:\n```sh\n$ license_finder licenses add my_unknown_dependency MIT --homepage=\"www.unknown-code.org\"\n```\nThis command would assign the MIT license to the dependency\n`my_unknown_dependency`. It will also set its homepage to `www.unknown-code.org`.\n### Adding Hidden Dependencies\n`license_finder` can track dependencies that your package managers\ndon't know about (JS libraries that don't appear in your\nGemfile/requirements.txt/package.json, etc.)\n```sh\n$ license_finder dependencies add my_js_dep MIT 0.1.2\n```\nRun `license_finder dependencies help` for\nadditional documentation about managing these dependencies.\n`license_finder` cannot automatically detect when one of these\ndependencies has been removed from your project, so you can use:\n```sh\n$ license_finder dependencies remove my_js_dep\n```\n### Excluding Dependencies\nSometimes a project will have development or test dependencies which\nyou don't want to track.  You can exclude theses dependencies by running\n`license_finder ignored_groups`.  (Currently this only works for packages\nmanaged by Bundler, NPM, Yarn, Maven, Pip2, Pip3, and Nuget.)\nOn rare occasions a package manager will report an individual dependency\nthat you want to exclude from all reports, even though it is approved.\nYou can exclude an individual dependency by running\n`license_finder ignored_dependencies`.  Think carefully before adding\ndependencies to this list.  A likely item to exclude is `bundler`,\nsince it is a common dependency whose version changes from machine to\nmachine.  Adding it to the `ignored_dependencies` would prevent it\n(and its oscillating versions) from appearing in reports.\n### Restricting Licenses\nSome projects will have a list of licenses that cannot be used.  You can\nrestrict these licenses with `license_finder restricted_licenses add`.  Any dependency\nthat has exclusively restricted licenses will always appear in the action\nitems, even if someone attempts to manually approve or permit it.  However,\nif a dependency has even one license that is not restricted, it can still be\nmanually approved or permitted.\n## Decision inheritance\nAdd or remove decision files you want to inherit from - see `license_finder inherited_decisions help` for more information.\nThis allows you to have a centralized decision file for approved/restricted licenses. If you have multiple projects it's way easier to have one single place where you approved or restricted licenses defined.\nAdd one or more decision files to the inherited decisions\n```bash\nlicense_finder inherited_decisions add DECISION_FILE\n```\nRemove one or more decision files from the inherited decisions\n```bash\nlicense_finder inherited_decisions remove DECISION_FILE\n```\nList all the inherited decision files\n```bash\nlicense_finder inherited_decisions list\n```\n## Configuration\nBe default, `license_finder` expects the decisions file to be stored at\n`doc/dependency_decisions.yml`.  All commands can be passed `--decisions_file`\nto override this location.\n### Package Manager Configuration\nIf you have a gradle project, you can invoke gradle with a custom script by\npassing (for example) `--gradle_command gradlew` to `license_finder` or\n`license_finder report`.\nSimilarly you can invoke a custom rebar script with `--rebar_command rebar`.\nIf you store rebar dependencies in a custom directory (by setting `deps_dir` in\n`rebar.config`), set `--rebar_deps_dir`.\nYou can also invoke a custom Mix script `remix` with `--mix_command remix` and\nset `--mix_deps_dir` to fetch Mix dependencies from a custom directory.\n### Narrow down Package Manager\nBy default, license_finder will check for all supported package managers,\nbut you can narrow it down to use only those you pass to `--enabled-package-managers`.\nFor example,\n```\n$ license_finder --enabled-package-managers bundler npm\n```\n### Saving Configuration\nIt may be difficult to remember to pass command line options to every command.\nIn some of these cases you can store default values in a YAML formatted config\nfile. `license_finder` looks for this file in `config/license_finder.yml`.\nAs an example, the file might look like this:\n```yaml\n---\ndecisions_file: './some_path/decisions.yml'\ngradle_command: './gradlew'\nrebar_command: './rebarw'\nrebar_deps_dir: './rebar_deps'\nmix_command: './mixw'\nmix_deps_dir: './mix_deps'\nenabled_package_managers:\n  - bundler\n  - gradle\n  - rebar\n  - mix\n```\n### Gradle Projects\n`license_finder` supports both Gradle 1.x and Gradle 2.x. You need to have installed\nthe license-gradle-plugin in your project:\n[https://github.com/hierynomus/license-gradle-plugin](https://github.com/hierynomus/license-gradle-plugin)\nBy default, `license_finder` will report on Gradle's \"runtime\" dependencies. If\nyou want to generate a report for some other dependency configuration (e.g.\nAndroid projects will sometimes specify their meaningful dependencies in the\n\"compile\" group), you can specify it in your project's `build.gradle`:\n```\n// Must come *after* applying the appropriate plugin from [https://github.com/hierynomus/license-gradle-plugin](https://github.com/hierynomus/license-gradle-plugin)\ndownloadLicenses {\n  dependencyConfiguration \"compile\"\n}\n```\n### Conan Projects\n`license_finder` supports Conan. You need to have the following lines in your conanfile.txt for `license_finder` to retrieve dependencies' licenses.\nEnsure that `conan install` does not generate an error.\n```\n[imports]\n., license* -> ./licenses @ folder=True, ignore_case=True\n```\n### SBT Projects\n`license_finder` supports SBT. You need to have installed the sbt-license-report in your project:\n[https://github.com/sbt/sbt-license-report](https://github.com/sbt/sbt-license-report)\nBy default, `license_finder` will report on SBT's \"compile\" and \"test\" dependencies. If\nyou want to generate a report for some other dependency configuration, you can specify\nit in your projects's `build.sbt`\n```\nlicenseConfigurations := Set(\"compile\", \"provided\")\n```\n## Requirements\n`license_finder` requires ruby >= 2.4.0. We will be dropping 2.4.x support soon.\n## Upgrading\nTo upgrade to `license_finder` version >= 6.0, you have to replace the terminology `whitelist` with `permit` and  `blacklist` with `restrict` in your `dependency_decisions.yml`. See [Changelog](https://github.com/pivotal/LicenseFinder/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#600--2020-01-22) for more details.\nTo upgrade from `license_finder` version 1.2 to 2.0, see\n[`license_finder_upgrade`](https://github.com/mainej/license_finder_upgrade).\nTo upgrade to 2.0 from a version lower than 1.2, first upgrade to 1.2, and run\n`license_finder` at least once.  This will ensure that the `license_finder`\ndatabase is in a state which `license_finder_upgrade` understands.\n## A Plea to Package Authors and Maintainers\nPlease add a license to your package specs! Most packaging systems\nallow for the specification of one or more licenses.\nFor example, Ruby Gems can specify a license by name:\n```ruby\nGem::Specification.new do |s|\n  s.name = \"my_great_gem\"\n  s.license = \"MIT\"\nend\n```\nAnd save a `LICENSE` file which contains your license text in your repo.\n## Known issues with specific package managers\n* Bundler\n   * When using `--project-path`, Bundler cannot find the Gemfile.\n* Yarn\n   * A module that is incompatible with the platform on which\n     license_finder is run will always be reported to have a license type\n     of \"unknown\".

By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n                            NO WARRANTY\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Of course, the commands you use may\nbe called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be\nmouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\nnecessary.

ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM\nCONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.\n1. DEFINITIONS\n\"Contribution\" means:\n     a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and\n     documentation distributed under this Agreement, and\n     b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:\n          i) changes to the Program, and\n          ii) additions to the Program;\nwhere such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are\ndistributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a\nContributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or\nanyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include\nadditions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software\ndistributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement,\nand (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.\n\"Contributor\" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.\n\"Licensed Patents\" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are\nnecessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when\ncombined with the Program.\n\"Program\" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this\nAgreement.\n\"Recipient\" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,\nincluding all Contributors.\n2. GRANT OF RIGHTS\n     a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants\n     Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to\n     reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly\n     perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor,\n     if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.\n     b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants\n     Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under\n     Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise\n     transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and\n     object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of\n     the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is\n     added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such\n     combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license\n     shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution.\n     No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.\n     c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the\n     licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are\n     provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent\n     or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each\n     Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by\n     any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or\n     otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted\n     hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure\n     any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a\n     third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute\n     the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license\n     before distributing the Program.\n     d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient\n     copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright\n     license set forth in this Agreement.\n3. REQUIREMENTS\nA Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under\nits own license agreement, provided that:\n     a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and\n     b) its license agreement:\n          i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all\n          warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties\n          or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties\n          or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular\n          purpose;\n          ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability\n          for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and\n          consequential damages, such as lost profits;\n          iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are\n          offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and\n          iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such\n          Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable\n          manner on or through a medium customarily used for software\n          exchange.\nWhen the Program is made available in source code form:\n     a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and\n     b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the\n     Program.\nContributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within\nthe Program.\nEach Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution,\nif any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify\nthe originator of the Contribution.\n4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\nCommercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with\nrespect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is\nintended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who\nincludes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner\nwhich does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore,\nif a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such\nContributor (\"Commercial Contributor\") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify\nevery other Contributor (\"Indemnified Contributor\") against any losses,\ndamages and costs (collectively \"Losses\") arising from claims, lawsuits and\nother legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified\nContributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial\nContributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial\nproduct offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims\nor Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property\ninfringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a)\npromptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b)\nallow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial\nContributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The\nIndemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.\nFor example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product\noffering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If\nthat Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers\nwarranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are\nsuch Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the\nCommercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other\nContributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a\ncourt requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the\nCommercial Contributor must pay those damages.\n5. NO WARRANTY\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN\n\"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,\nNON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each\nRecipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using\nand distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its\nexercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to the\nrisks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to\nor loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of\noperations.\n6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY\nCONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,\nSPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION\nLOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN\nCONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)\nARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE\nEXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY\nOF SUCH DAMAGES.\n7. GENERAL\nIf any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under\napplicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the\nremainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the\nparties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent\nnecessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\nIf Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a\ncross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself\n(excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware)\ninfringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted\nunder Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\nAll Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to\ncomply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does\nnot cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of\nsuch noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate,\nRecipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as\nreasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement\nand any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue\nand survive.\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in\norder to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be\nmodified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to\npublish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to\ntime. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this\nAgreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The\nEclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement\nSteward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will\nbe given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including\nContributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the\nAgreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the\nAgreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program\n(including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly\nstated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or\nlicenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement,\nwhether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the\nProgram not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.\nThis Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the\nintellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this\nAgreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year\nafter the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial\nin any resulting litigation.\n---\ntitle: Apache License 2.0\nspdx-id: Apache-2.0\nredirect_from: /licenses/apache/\nfeatured: true\nhidden: false\ndescription: A permissive license whose main conditions require preservation of copyright and license notices.

Limitations on Grant Scope\nThe licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under\nthis License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the\ndistribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.\nNotwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a\nContributor:\n(a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;\n    or\n(b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's\n    modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its\n    Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor\n    Version); or\n(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of\n    its Contributions.\nThis License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,\nor logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with\nthe notice requirements in Section 3.4).\n2.4. Subsequent Licenses\nNo Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to\ndistribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this\nLicense (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if\npermitted under the terms of Section 3.3).\n2.5. Representation\nEach Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its\nContributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights\nto grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.\n2.6.

Conditions\nSections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted\nin Section 2.1.\n3. Responsibilities\n-------------------\n3.1. Distribution of Source Form\nAll distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any\nModifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under\nthe terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source\nCode Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this\nLicense, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not\nattempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code\nForm.\n3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\nIf You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\n(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code\n    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of\n    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code\n    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more\n    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and\n(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this\n    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the\n    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter\n    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\n3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work\nYou may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,\nprovided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for\nthe Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered\nSoftware with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the\nCovered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this\nLicense permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software\nunder the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of\nthe Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered\nSoftware under the terms of either this License or such Secondary\nLicense(s).\n3.4. Notices\nYou may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices\n(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,\nor limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of\nthe Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to\nthe extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.\n3.5. Application of Additional Terms\nYou may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,\nindemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered\nSoftware. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on\nbehalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any\nsuch warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by\nYou alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any\nliability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,\nindemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional\ndisclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any\njurisdiction.\n4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation\n---------------------------------------------------\nIf it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this\nLicense with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to\nstatute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with\nthe terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)\ndescribe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must\nbe placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered\nSoftware under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute\nor regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a\nrecipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\n5. Termination\n--------------\n5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically\nif You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become\ncompliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular\nContributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such\nContributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an\nongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the\nnon-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have\ncome back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular\nContributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor\nnotifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the\nfirst time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License\nfrom such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after\nYour receipt of the notice.\n5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent\ninfringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,\ncounter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version\ndirectly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to\nYou by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section\n2.1 of this License shall terminate.\n5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all\nend user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which\nhave been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License\nprior to termination shall survive termination.\n************************************************************************\n*                                                                      *\n*  6.

Additional Definitions.\n  As used herein, \"this License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, and the \"GNU GPL\" refers to version 3 of the GNU\nGeneral Public License.\n  \"The Library\" refers to a covered work governed by this License,\nother than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.\n  An \"Application\" is any work that makes use of an interface provided\nby the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.\nDefining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode\nof using an interface provided by the Library.\n  A \"Combined Work\" is a work produced by combining or linking an\nApplication with the Library.  The particular version of the Library\nwith which the Combined Work was made is also called the \"Linked\nVersion\".\n  The \"Minimal Corresponding Source\" for a Combined Work means the\nCorresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code\nfor portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are\nbased on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.\n  The \"Corresponding Application Code\" for a Combined Work means the\nobject code and/or source code for the Application, including any data\nand utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the\nApplication, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.\n  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License\nwithout being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n  2. Conveying Modified Versions.\n  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a\nfacility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application\nthat uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the\nfacility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified\nversion:\n   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to\n   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the\n   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs\n   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\n   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of\n   this License applicable to that copy.\n  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.\n  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from\na header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object\ncode under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated\nmaterial is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure\nlayouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates\n(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the\n   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n  4. Combined Works.\n  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,\ntaken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the\nportions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of\nthe following:\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that\n   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during\n   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among\n   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the\n   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n   d) Do one of the following:\n       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this\n       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form\n       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to\n       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of\n       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the\n       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying\n       Corresponding Source.\n       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time\n       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer\n       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version\n       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked\n       Version.\n   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise\n   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the\n   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is\n   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the\n   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the\n   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If\n   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany\n   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application\n   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation\n   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL\n   for conveying Corresponding Source.)\n  5. Combined Libraries.\n  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side by side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this\nLicense, and convey such a combined library under terms of your\nchoice, if you do both of the following:\n   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based\n   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,\n   conveyed under the terms of this License.\n   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it\n   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the\n   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new\nversions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\ndiffer in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the\nLibrary as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License \"or any later version\"\napplies to it, you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that published version or of any later version\npublished by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you\nreceived it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide\nwhether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall\napply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is\npermanent authorization for you to choose that version for the\nLibrary.\n---\ntitle: GNU General Public License v3.0\nspdx-id: GPL-3.0\nnickname: GNU GPLv3\nredirect_from: /licenses/gpl-v3/\nfeatured: true\nhidden: false\ndescription: Permissions of this strong copyleft license are conditioned on making available complete source code of licensed works and modifications, which include larger works using a licensed work, under the same license.

By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n  0. Definitions.\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n  1. Source Code.\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n  7. Additional Terms.\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n  8. Termination.\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n  11. Patents.\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\nnotice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands\nmight be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".\n  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see\n<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\ninto proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you\nmay consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with\nthe library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License.

DISTRIBUTION OF THIS DOCUMENT DOES NOT CREATE AN\n    ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS\n    INFORMATION ON AN \"AS-IS\" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES\n    REGARDING THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS\n    PROVIDED HEREUNDER, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM\n    THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED\n    HEREUNDER.\nStatement of Purpose\nThe laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer\nexclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator\nand subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an \"owner\") of an original work of\nauthorship and/or a database (each, a \"Work\").\nCertain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for\nthe purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and\nscientific works (\"Commons\") that the public can reliably and without fear\nof later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other\nworks, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever\nand for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes.\nThese owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free\nculture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific\nworks, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in\npart through the use and efforts of others.\nFor these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any\nexpectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person\nassociating CC0 with a Work (the \"Affirmer\"), to the extent that he or she\nis an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily\nelects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its\nterms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the\nWork and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.\n1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be\nprotected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (\"Copyright and\nRelated Rights\"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not\nlimited to, the following:\n  i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,\n     communicate, and translate a Work;\n ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);\niii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or\n     likeness depicted in a Work;\n iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,\n     subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;\n  v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data\n     in a Work;\n vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the\n     European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal\n     protection of databases, and under any national implementation\n     thereof, including any amended or successor version of such\n     directive); and\nvii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the\n     world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national\n     implementations thereof.\n2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention\nof, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently,\nirrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of\nAffirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes\nof action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as\nfuture claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories\nworldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or\ntreaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future\nmedium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever,\nincluding without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional\npurposes (the \"Waiver\"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each\nmember of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and\nsuccessors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to\nrevocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or\nequitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public\nas contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.\n3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason\nbe judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the\nWaiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into\naccount Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the\nextent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected\nperson a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,\nirrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and\nRelated Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the\nmaximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future\ntime extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number\nof copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without\nlimitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the\n\"License\"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was\napplied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any\nreason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such\npartial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder\nof the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she\nwill not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related\nRights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of\naction with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's\nexpress Statement of Purpose.\n4. Limitations and Disclaimers.\n a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,\n    surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.\n b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or\n    warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied,\n    statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of\n    title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non\n    infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or\n    the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to\n    the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.\n c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons\n    that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without\n    limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.\n    Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary\n    consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the\n    Work.\n d.

By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\nTo protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\nDevelopers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\nFor the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\nSome devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\nFinally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n0. Definitions.\n\"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\nTo \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\nA \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\nTo \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\nTo \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\nAn interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n1. Source Code.\nThe \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\nA \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\nThe \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\nThe \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\nThe Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\nThe Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n2. Basic Permissions.\nAll rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\nYou may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\nConveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\nNo covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\nWhen you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\nYou may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\nYou may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\nYou may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\na) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\nit, and giving a relevant date.\nb) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\nreleased under this License and any conditions added under section\n7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n\"keep intact all notices\".\nc) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\nLicense to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\nLicense will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\nadditional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\nregardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\npermission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\ninvalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\nd) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\nAppropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\ninterfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\nwork need not make them do so.\nA compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\nYou may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\na) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\nCorresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\ncustomarily used for software interchange.\nb) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\nwritten offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\nlong as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\nmodel, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\ncopy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\nproduct that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\nmedium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\nmore than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\nconveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\nCorresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\nc) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\nwritten offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\nalternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\nonly if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\nwith subsection 6b.\nd) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\nplace (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\nCorresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\nfurther charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\nCorresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\ncopy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\nmay be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\nthat supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\nclear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\nCorresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\nCorresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\navailable for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\ne) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\nyou inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\nSource of the work are being offered to the general public at no\ncharge under subsection 6d.\nA separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\nA \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\nIf you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\nThe requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\nCorresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n7. Additional Terms.\n\"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\nWhen you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\na) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\nterms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\nb) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\nauthor attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\nNotices displayed by works containing it; or\nc) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\nrequiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\nreasonable ways as different from the original version; or\nd) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\nauthors of the material; or\ne) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\ntrade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\nf) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\nmaterial by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\nit) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\nany liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\nthose licensors and authors.\nAll other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\nIf you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\nAdditional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n8. Termination.\nYou may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\nHowever, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\nMoreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\nTermination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\nYou are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\nEach time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\nAn \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\nYou may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n11. Patents.\nA \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\nA contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\nEach contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\nIn the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\nIf you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\nIf, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\nA patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\nNothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\nIf conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n14. Revised Versions of this License.\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\nIf the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\nLater license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\nTHERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.

Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\nIf the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n{one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.}\nCopyright (C) {year}  {name of author}\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\nthe Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n(at your option) any later version.\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\nGNU General Public License for more details.\nYou should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\nalong with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\nIf the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\nnotice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n{project}  Copyright (C) {year}  {fullname}\nThis program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\nThis is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\nunder certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands\nmight be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see\n<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\nThe GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\ninto proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you\nmay consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with\nthe library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License.

DISTRIBUTION OF THIS DOCUMENT DOES NOT CREATE AN\n    ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS\n    INFORMATION ON AN \"AS-IS\" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES\n    REGARDING THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS\n    PROVIDED HEREUNDER, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM\n    THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED\n    HEREUNDER.\nStatement of Purpose\nThe laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer\nexclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator\nand subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an \"owner\") of an original work of\nauthorship and/or a database (each, a \"Work\").\nCertain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for\nthe purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and\nscientific works (\"Commons\") that the public can reliably and without fear\nof later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other\nworks, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever\nand for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes.\nThese owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free\nculture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific\nworks, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in\npart through the use and efforts of others.\nFor these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any\nexpectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person\nassociating CC0 with a Work (the \"Affirmer\"), to the extent that he or she\nis an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily\nelects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its\nterms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the\nWork and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.\n1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be\nprotected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (\"Copyright and\nRelated Rights\"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not\nlimited to, the following:\n  i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,\n     communicate, and translate a Work;\n ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);\niii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or\n     likeness depicted in a Work;\n iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,\n     subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;\n  v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data\n     in a Work;\n vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the\n     European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal\n     protection of databases, and under any national implementation\n     thereof, including any amended or successor version of such\n     directive); and\nvii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the\n     world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national\n     implementations thereof.\n2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention\nof, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently,\nirrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of\nAffirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes\nof action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as\nfuture claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories\nworldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or\ntreaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future\nmedium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever,\nincluding without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional\npurposes (the \"Waiver\"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each\nmember of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and\nsuccessors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to\nrevocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or\nequitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public\nas contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.\n3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason\nbe judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the\nWaiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into\naccount Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the\nextent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected\nperson a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,\nirrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and\nRelated Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the\nmaximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future\ntime extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number\nof copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without\nlimitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the\n\"License\"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was\napplied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any\nreason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such\npartial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder\nof the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she\nwill not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related\nRights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of\naction with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's\nexpress Statement of Purpose.\n4. Limitations and Disclaimers.\n a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,\n    surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.\n b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or\n    warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied,\n    statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of\n    title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non\n    infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or\n    the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to\n    the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.\n c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons\n    that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without\n    limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.\n    Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary\n    consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the\n    Work.\n d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a\n    party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to\n    this CC0 or use of the Work.\nGNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n    Version 3, 29 June 2007\nCopyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\nof this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\nThis version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates\nthe terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public\nLicense, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.\n0. Additional Definitions.\nAs used herein, \"this License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, and the \"GNU GPL\" refers to version 3 of the GNU\nGeneral Public License.\n\"The Library\" refers to a covered work governed by this License,\nother than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.\nAn \"Application\" is any work that makes use of an interface provided\nby the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.\nDefining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode\nof using an interface provided by the Library.\nA \"Combined Work\" is a work produced by combining or linking an\nApplication with the Library.  The particular version of the Library\nwith which the Combined Work was made is also called the \"Linked\nVersion\".\nThe \"Minimal Corresponding Source\" for a Combined Work means the\nCorresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code\nfor portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are\nbased on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.\nThe \"Corresponding Application Code\" for a Combined Work means the\nobject code and/or source code for the Application, including any data\nand utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the\nApplication, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.\n1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\nYou may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License\nwithout being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n2. Conveying Modified Versions.\nIf you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a\nfacility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application\nthat uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the\nfacility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified\nversion:\na) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to\nensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the\nfunction or data, the facility still operates, and performs\nwhatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\nb) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of\nthis License applicable to that copy.\n3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.\nThe object code form of an Application may incorporate material from\na header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object\ncode under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated\nmaterial is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure\nlayouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates\n(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:\na) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the\nLibrary is used in it and that the Library and its use are\ncovered by this License.\nb) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\ndocument.\n4. Combined Works.\nYou may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,\ntaken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the\nportions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of\nthe following:\na) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that\nthe Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\ncovered by this License.\nb) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\ndocument.\nc) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during\nexecution, include the copyright notice for the Library among\nthese notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the\ncopies of the GNU GPL and this license document.\nd) Do one of the following:\n0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this\nLicense, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form\nsuitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to\nrecombine or relink the Application with a modified version of\nthe Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the\nmanner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying\nCorresponding Source.\n1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\nLibrary.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time\na copy of the Library already present on the user's computer\nsystem, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version\nof the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked\nVersion.\ne) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise\nbe required to provide such information under section 6 of the\nGNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is\nnecessary to install and execute a modified version of the\nCombined Work produced by recombining or relinking the\nApplication with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If\nyou use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany\nthe Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application\nCode. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation\nInformation in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL\nfor conveying Corresponding Source.)\n5. Combined Libraries.\nYou may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side by side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this\nLicense, and convey such a combined library under terms of your\nchoice, if you do both of the following:\na) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based\non the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,\nconveyed under the terms of this License.\nb) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it\nis a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the\naccompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new\nversions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\ndiffer in detail to address new problems or concerns.\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the\nLibrary as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License \"or any later version\"\napplies to it, you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that published version or of any later version\npublished by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you\nreceived it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\nIf the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide\nwhether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall\napply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is\npermanent authorization for you to choose that version for the\nLibrary.\nGNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   Version 3, 29 June 2007\nCopyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\nof this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n        Preamble\nThe GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for\nsoftware and other kinds of works.\nThe licenses for most software and other practical works are designed\nto take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\nTo protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\nDevelopers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\nFor the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\nSome devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\nFinally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n0. Definitions.\n\"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\nTo \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\nA \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\nTo \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\nTo \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\nAn interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n1. Source Code.\nThe \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\nA \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\nThe \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\nThe \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\nThe Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\nThe Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n2. Basic Permissions.\nAll rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\nYou may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\nConveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\nNo covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\nWhen you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\nYou may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\nYou may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\nYou may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\na) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\nit, and giving a relevant date.\nb) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\nreleased under this License and any conditions added under section\n7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n\"keep intact all notices\".\nc) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\nLicense to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\nLicense will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\nadditional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\nregardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\npermission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\ninvalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\nd) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\nAppropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\ninterfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\nwork need not make them do so.\nA compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\nYou may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\na) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\nCorresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\ncustomarily used for software interchange.\nb) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\nwritten offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\nlong as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\nmodel, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\ncopy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\nproduct that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\nmedium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\nmore than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\nconveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\nCorresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\nc) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\nwritten offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\nalternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\nonly if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\nwith subsection 6b.\nd) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\nplace (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\nCorresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\nfurther charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\nCorresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\ncopy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\nmay be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\nthat supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\nclear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\nCorresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\nCorresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\navailable for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\ne) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\nyou inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\nSource of the work are being offered to the general public at no\ncharge under subsection 6d.\nA separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\nA \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\nIf you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\nThe requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\nCorresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n7. Additional Terms.\n\"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\nWhen you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\na) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\nterms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\nb) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\nauthor attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\nNotices displayed by works containing it; or\nc) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\nrequiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\nreasonable ways as different from the original version; or\nd) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\nauthors of the material; or\ne) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\ntrade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\nf) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\nmaterial by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\nit) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\nany liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\nthose licensors and authors.\nAll other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\nIf you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\nAdditional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n8. Termination.\nYou may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\nHowever, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\nMoreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\nTermination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\nYou are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\nEach time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\nAn \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\nYou may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n11. Patents.\nA \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\nA contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\nEach contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\nIn the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\nIf you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\nIf, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\nA patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\nNothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\nIf conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n14. Revised Versions of this License.\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\nIf the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\nLater license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\nTHERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n16. Limitation of Liability.\nIN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\nIf the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n{one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.}\nCopyright (C) {year}  {name of author}\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\nthe Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n(at your option) any later version.\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

License Grants and Conditions\n2.1. Grants\n     Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,\n     non-exclusive license:\n     a. under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)\n        Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,\n        modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its\n        Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or as\n        part of a Larger Work; and\n     b. under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer for\n        sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its Contributions\n        or its Contributor Version.\n2.2. Effective Date\n     The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution become\n     effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first distributes\n     such Contribution.\n2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope\n     The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under this\n     License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the distribution\n     or licensing of Covered Software under this License. Notwithstanding Section\n     2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a Contributor:\n     a. for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or\n     b. for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third partyâs\n        modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its\n        Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor\n        Version); or\n     c. under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its\n        Contributions.\n     This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or\n     logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the\n     notice requirements in Section 3.4).\n2.4. Subsequent Licenses\n     No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to\n     distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License\n     (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted\n     under the terms of Section 3.3).\n2.5. Representation\n     Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions\n     are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the\n     rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.\n2.6. Fair Use\n     This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable\n     copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.\n2.7. Conditions\n     Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in\n     Section 2.1.\n3. Responsibilities\n3.1. Distribution of Source Form\n     All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any\n     Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the\n     terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form\n     of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how\n     they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or\n     restrict the recipientsâ rights in the Source Code Form.\n3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\n     If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\n     a. such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form,\n        as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the\n        Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by\n        reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost\n        of distribution to the recipient; and\n     b. You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License,\n        or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for\n        the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipientsâ\n        rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\n3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work\n     You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,\n     provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the\n     Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software\n     with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered\n     Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits\n     You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of\n     such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at\n     their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of\n     either this License or such Secondary License(s).\n3.4. Notices\n     You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including\n     copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations\n     of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered\n     Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent\n     required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.\n3.5. Application of Additional Terms\n     You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,\n     indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered\n     Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf\n     of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such\n     warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You\n     alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any\n     liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,\n     indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional\n     disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any\n     jurisdiction.\n4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation\n   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License\n   with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial\n   order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License\n   to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code\n   they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all\n   distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the\n   extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be\n   sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to\n   understand it.\n5. Termination\n5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You\n     fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant,\n     then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor\n     are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor\n     explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis,\n     if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some\n     reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance.\n     Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an\n     ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by\n     some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of\n     non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become\n     compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.\n5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent\n     infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims,\n     and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or\n     indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and\n     all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License\n     shall terminate.\n5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user\n     license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been\n     validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to\n     termination shall survive termination.\n6. Disclaimer of Warranty\n   Covered Software is provided under this License on an âas isâ basis, without\n   warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including,\n   without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects,\n   merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire\n   risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.\n   Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any\n   Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or\n   correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this\n   License. No use of  any Covered Software is authorized under this License\n   except under this disclaimer.\n7. Limitation of Liability\n   Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including\n   negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who\n   distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any\n   direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any\n   character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of\n   goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n   other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been\n   informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability\n   shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such\n   partyâs negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.\n   Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or\n   consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.\n8. Litigation\n   Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of\n   a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business\n   and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without\n   reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall\n   prevent a partyâs ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.\n9. Miscellaneous\n   This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter\n   hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such\n   provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it\n   enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a\n   contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe\n   this License against a Contributor.\n10. Versions of the License\n10.1. New Versions\n      Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section\n      10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or\n      publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a\n      distinguishing version number.\n10.2. Effect of New Versions\n      You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of\n      the License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or\n      under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license\n      steward.\n10.3. Modified Versions\n      If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to\n      create a new license for such software, you may create and use a modified\n      version of this License if you rename the license and remove any\n      references to the name of the license steward (except to note that such\n      modified license differs from this License).\n10.4.

All network\ntype actions are done through proxy methods to Net::SMTP, Net::POP3 etc.\nBuilt from my experience with TMail, it is designed to be a pure ruby\nimplementation that makes generating, sending and parsing emails a no\nbrainer.\nIt is also designed from the ground up to work with the more modern versions\nof Ruby.  This is because Ruby > 1.9 handles text encodings much more wonderfully\nthan Ruby 1.8.x and so these features have been taken full advantage of in this\nlibrary allowing Mail to handle a lot more messages more cleanly than TMail.\nMail does run on Ruby 1.8.x... it's just not as fun to code.\nFinally, Mail has been designed with a very simple object oriented system\nthat really opens up the email messages you are parsing, if you know what\nyou are doing, you can fiddle with every last bit of your email directly.\n## Donations\nMail has been downloaded millions of times, by people around the world, in fact,\nit represents more than 1% of *all* gems downloaded.\nIt is (like all open source software) a labour of love and something I am doing\nwith my own free time.  If you would like to say thanks, please feel free to\n[make a donation](http://www.pledgie.com/campaigns/8790) and feel free to send\nme a nice email :)\n<a href='http://www.pledgie.com/campaigns/8790'><img alt='Click here to lend your support to: mail and make a donation at www.pledgie.com !' src='http://www.pledgie.com/campaigns/8790.png?skin_name=chrome' border='0' /></a>\n# Contents\n* [Compatibility](#compatibility)\n* [Discussion](#discussion)\n* [Current Capabilities of Mail](#current-capabilities-of-mail)\n* [Roadmap](#roadmap)\n* [Testing Policy](#testing-policy)\n* [API Policy](#api-policy)\n* [Installation](#installation)\n* [Encodings](#encodings)\n* [Contributing](#contributing)\n* [Usage](#usage)\n* [Core Extensions](#core-extensions)\n* [Excerpts from TREC Span Corpus 2005](#excerpts-from-trec-span-corpus-2005)\n* [License](#license)\n## Compatibility\nMail supports Ruby 1.8.7+, including JRuby and Rubinius.\nEvery Mail commit is tested by Travis on [all supported Ruby versions](https://github.com/mikel/mail/blob/master/.travis.yml).\n## Discussion\nIf you want to discuss mail with like minded individuals, please subscribe to\nthe [Google Group](http://groups.google.com/group/mail-ruby).\n## Current Capabilities of Mail\n* RFC5322 Support, Reading and Writing\n* RFC6532 Support, reading UTF-8 headers\n* RFC2045-2049 Support for multipart emails\n* Support for creating multipart alternate emails\n* Support for reading multipart/report emails &amp; getting details from such\n* Wrappers for File, Net/POP3, Net/SMTP\n* Auto-encoding of non-US-ASCII bodies and header fields\nMail is RFC5322 and RFC6532 compliant now, that is, it can parse US-ASCII and UTF-8\nemails and generate US-ASCII emails. There are a few obsoleted syntax emails that\nit will have problems with, but it also is quite robust, meaning, if it finds something\nit doesn't understand it will not crash, instead, it will skip the problem and keep\nparsing. In the case of a header it doesn't understand, it will initialise the header\nas an optional unstructured field and continue parsing.\nThis means Mail won't (ever) crunch your data (I think).\nYou can also create MIME emails.  There are helper methods for making a\nmultipart/alternate email for text/plain and text/html (the most common pair)\nand you can manually create any other type of MIME email.\n## Roadmap\nNext TODO:\n* Improve MIME support for character sets in headers, currently works, mostly, needs\n  refinement.\n## Testing Policy\nBasically... we do BDD on Mail.  No method gets written in Mail without a\ncorresponding or covering spec.  We expect as a minimum 100% coverage\nmeasured by RCov.  While this is not perfect by any measure, it is pretty\ngood.  Additionally, all functional tests from TMail are to be passing before\nthe gem gets released.\nIt also means you can be sure Mail will behave correctly.\nNote: If you care about core extensions (aka \"monkey-patching\"), please read the Core Extensions section near the end of this README.\n## API Policy\nNo API removals within a single point release.  All removals to be deprecated with\nwarnings for at least one MINOR point release before removal.\nAlso, all private or protected methods to be declared as such - though this is still I/P.\n## Installation\nInstallation is fairly simple, I host mail on rubygems, so you can just do:\n    # gem install mail\n## Encodings\nIf you didn't know, handling encodings in Emails is not as straight forward as you\nwould hope.\nI have tried to simplify it some:\n1. All objects that can render into an email, have an `#encoded` method.  Encoded will\n   return the object as a complete string ready to send in the mail system, that is,\n   it will include the header field and value and CRLF at the end and wrapped as\n   needed.\n2. All objects that can render into an email, have a `#decoded` method.  Decoded will\n   return the object's \"value\" only as a string.  This means it will not include\n   the header fields (like 'To:' or 'Subject:').\n3. By default, calling <code>#to_s</code> on a container object will call its encoded\n   method, while <code>#to_s</code> on a field object will call its decoded method.\n   So calling <code>#to_s</code> on a Mail object will return the mail, all encoded\n   ready to send, while calling <code>#to_s</code> on the From field or the body will\n   return the decoded value of the object. The header object of Mail is considered a\n   container. If you are in doubt, call <code>#encoded</code>, or <code>#decoded</code>\n   explicitly, this is safer if you are not sure.\n4. Structured fields that have parameter values that can be encoded (e.g. Content-Type) will\n   provide decoded parameter values when you call the parameter names as methods against\n   the object.\n5. Structured fields that have parameter values that can be encoded (e.g. Content-Type) will\n   provide encoded parameter values when you call the parameter names through the\n   <code>object.parameters['<parameter_name>']</code> method call.\n## Contributing\nPlease do!  Contributing is easy in Mail.  Please read the CONTRIBUTING.md document for more info\n## Usage\nAll major mail functions should be able to happen from the Mail module.\nSo, you should be able to just <code>require 'mail'</code> to get started.\n### Making an email\n```ruby\nmail = Mail.new do\n  from    'mikel@test.lindsaar.net'\n  to      'you@test.lindsaar.net'\n  subject 'This is a test email'\n  body    File.read('body.txt')\nend\nmail.to_s #=> \"From: mikel@test.lindsaar.net\\r\\nTo: you@...\n```\n### Making an email, have it your way:\n```ruby\nmail = Mail.new do\n  body File.read('body.txt')\nend\nmail['from'] = 'mikel@test.lindsaar.net'\nmail[:to]    = 'you@test.lindsaar.net'\nmail.subject = 'This is a test email'\nmail.header['X-Custom-Header'] = 'custom value'\nmail.to_s #=> \"From: mikel@test.lindsaar.net\\r\\nTo: you@...\n```\n### Don't Worry About Message IDs:\n```ruby\nmail = Mail.new do\n  to   'you@test.lindsaar.net'\n  body 'Some simple body'\nend\nmail.to_s =~ /Message\\-ID: <[\\d\\w_]+@.+.mail/ #=> 27\n```\nMail will automatically add a Message-ID field if it is missing and\ngive it a unique, random Message-ID along the lines of:\n    <4a7ff76d7016_13a81ab802e1@local.host.mail>\n### Or do worry about Message-IDs:\n```ruby\nmail = Mail.new do\n  to         'you@test.lindsaar.net'\n  message_id '<ThisIsMyMessageId@some.domain.com>'\n  body       'Some simple body'\nend\nmail.to_s =~ /Message\\-ID: <ThisIsMyMessageId@some.domain.com>/ #=> 27\n```\nMail will take the message_id you assign to it trusting that you know\nwhat you are doing.\n### Sending an email:\nMail defaults to sending via SMTP to local host port 25.  If you have a\nsendmail or postfix daemon running on this port, sending email is as\neasy as:\n```ruby\nMail.deliver do\n  from     'me@test.lindsaar.net'\n  to       'you@test.lindsaar.net'\n  subject  'Here is the image you wanted'\n  body     File.read('body.txt')\n  add_file '/full/path/to/somefile.png'\nend\n```\nor\n```ruby\nmail = Mail.new do\n  from     'me@test.lindsaar.net'\n  to       'you@test.lindsaar.net'\n  subject  'Here is the image you wanted'\n  body     File.read('body.txt')\n  add_file :filename => 'somefile.png', :content => File.read('/somefile.png')\nend\nmail.deliver!\n```\nSending via sendmail can be done like so:\n```ruby\nmail = Mail.new do\n  from     'me@test.lindsaar.net'\n  to       'you@test.lindsaar.net'\n  subject  'Here is the image you wanted'\n  body     File.read('body.txt')\n  add_file :filename => 'somefile.png', :content => File.read('/somefile.png')\nend\nmail.delivery_method :sendmail\nmail.deliver\n```\nSending via smtp (for example to [mailcatcher](https://github.com/sj26/mailcatcher))\n```ruby\nMail.defaults do\n  delivery_method :smtp, address: \"localhost\", port: 1025\nend\n```\nExim requires its own delivery manager, and can be used like so:\n```ruby\nmail.delivery_method :exim, :location => \"/usr/bin/exim\"\nmail.deliver\n```\nMail may be \"delivered\" to a logfile, too, for development and testing:\n```ruby\n# Delivers by logging the encoded message to $stdout\nmail.delivery_method :logger\n# Delivers to an existing logger at :debug severity\nmail.delivery_method :logger, logger: other_logger, severity: :debug\n```\n### Getting Emails from a POP Server:\nYou can configure Mail to receive email using <code>retriever_method</code>\nwithin <code>Mail.defaults</code>:\n```ruby\nMail.defaults do\n  retriever_method :pop3, :address    => \"pop.gmail.com\",\n                          :port       => 995,\n                          :user_name  => '<username>',\n                          :password   => '<password>',\n                          :enable_ssl => true\nend\n```\nYou can access incoming email in a number of ways.\nThe most recent email:\n```ruby\nMail.all    #=> Returns an array of all emails\nMail.first  #=> Returns the first unread email\nMail.last   #=> Returns the last unread email\n```\nThe first 10 emails sorted by date in ascending order:\n```ruby\nemails = Mail.find(:what => :first, :count => 10, :order => :asc)\nemails.length #=> 10\n```\nOr even all emails:\n```ruby\nemails = Mail.all\nemails.length #=> LOTS!\n```\n### Reading an Email\n```ruby\nmail = Mail.read('/path/to/message.eml')\nmail.envelope_from   #=> 'mikel@test.lindsaar.net'\nmail.from.addresses  #=> ['mikel@test.lindsaar.net', 'ada@test.lindsaar.net']\nmail.sender.address  #=> 'mikel@test.lindsaar.net'\nmail.to              #=> 'bob@test.lindsaar.net'\nmail.cc              #=> 'sam@test.lindsaar.net'\nmail.subject         #=> \"This is the subject\"\nmail.date.to_s       #=> '21 Nov 1997 09:55:06 -0600'\nmail.message_id      #=> '<4D6AA7EB.6490534@xxx.xxx>'\nmail.decoded         #=> 'This is the body of the email...\n```\nMany more methods available.\n### Reading a Multipart Email\n```ruby\nmail = Mail.read('multipart_email')\nmail.multipart?          #=> true\nmail.parts.length        #=> 2\nmail.body.preamble       #=> \"Text before the first part\"\nmail.body.epilogue       #=> \"Text after the last part\"\nmail.parts.map { |p| p.content_type }  #=> ['text/plain', 'application/pdf']\nmail.parts.map { |p| p.class }         #=> [Mail::Message, Mail::Message]\nmail.parts[0].content_type_parameters  #=> {'charset' => 'ISO-8859-1'}\nmail.parts[1].content_type_parameters  #=> {'name' => 'my.pdf'}\n```\nMail generates a tree of parts.  Each message has many or no parts.  Each part\nis another message which can have many or no parts.\nA message will only have parts if it is a multipart/mixed or multipart/related\ncontent type and has a boundary defined.\n### Testing and Extracting Attachments\n```ruby\nmail.attachments.each do | attachment |\n  # Attachments is an AttachmentsList object containing a\n  # number of Part objects\n  if (attachment.content_type.start_with?('image/'))\n    # extracting images for example...\n    filename = attachment.filename\n    begin\n      File.open(images_dir + filename, \"w+b\", 0644) {|f| f.write attachment.decoded}\n    rescue => e\n      puts \"Unable to save data for #{filename} because #{e.message}\"\n    end\n  end\nend\n```\n### Writing and Sending a Multipart/Alternative (HTML and Text) Email\nMail makes some basic assumptions and makes doing the common thing as\nsimple as possible.... (asking a lot from a mail library)\n```ruby\nmail = Mail.deliver do\n  to      'nicolas@test.lindsaar.net.au'\n  from    'Mikel Lindsaar <mikel@test.lindsaar.net.au>'\n  subject 'First multipart email sent with Mail'\n  text_part do\n    body 'This is plain text'\n  end\n  html_part do\n    content_type 'text/html; charset=UTF-8'\n    body '<h1>This is HTML</h1>'\n  end\nend\n```\nMail then delivers the email at the end of the block and returns the\nresulting Mail::Message object, which you can then inspect if you\nso desire...\n```\nputs mail.to_s #=>\nTo: nicolas@test.lindsaar.net.au\nFrom: Mikel Lindsaar <mikel@test.lindsaar.net.au>\nSubject: First multipart email sent with Mail\nContent-Type: multipart/alternative;\n  boundary=--==_mimepart_4a914f0c911be_6f0f1ab8026659\nMessage-ID: <4a914f12ac7e_6f0f1ab80267d1@baci.local.mail>\nDate: Mon, 24 Aug 2009 00:15:46 +1000\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\n----==_mimepart_4a914f0c911be_6f0f1ab8026659\nContent-ID: <4a914f12c8c4_6f0f1ab80268d6@baci.local.mail>\nDate: Mon, 24 Aug 2009 00:15:46 +1000\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nThis is plain text\n----==_mimepart_4a914f0c911be_6f0f1ab8026659\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\nContent-ID: <4a914f12cf86_6f0f1ab802692c@baci.local.mail>\nDate: Mon, 24 Aug 2009 00:15:46 +1000\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\n<h1>This is HTML</h1>\n----==_mimepart_4a914f0c911be_6f0f1ab8026659--\n```\nMail inserts the content transfer encoding, the mime version,\nthe content-id's and handles the content-type and boundary.\nMail assumes that if your text in the body is only us-ascii, that your\ntransfer encoding is 7bit and it is text/plain.  You can override this\nby explicitly declaring it.\n### Making Multipart/Alternate, Without a Block\nYou don't have to use a block with the text and html part included, you\ncan just do it declaratively.  However, you need to add Mail::Parts to\nan email, not Mail::Messages.\n```ruby\nmail = Mail.new do\n  to      'nicolas@test.lindsaar.net.au'\n  from    'Mikel Lindsaar <mikel@test.lindsaar.net.au>'\n  subject 'First multipart email sent with Mail'\nend\ntext_part = Mail::Part.new do\n  body 'This is plain text'\nend\nhtml_part = Mail::Part.new do\n  content_type 'text/html; charset=UTF-8'\n  body '<h1>This is HTML</h1>'\nend\nmail.text_part = text_part\nmail.html_part = html_part\n```\nResults in the same email as done using the block form\n### Getting Error Reports from an Email:\n```ruby\n@mail = Mail.read('/path/to/bounce_message.eml')\n@mail.bounced?         #=> true\n@mail.final_recipient  #=> rfc822;mikel@dont.exist.com\n@mail.action           #=> failed\n@mail.error_status     #=> 5.5.0\n@mail.diagnostic_code  #=> smtp;550 Requested action not taken: mailbox unavailable\n@mail.retryable?       #=> false\n```\n### Attaching and Detaching Files\nYou can just read the file off an absolute path, Mail will try\nto guess the mime_type and will encode the file in Base64 for you.\n```ruby\n@mail = Mail.new\n@mail.add_file(\"/path/to/file.jpg\")\n@mail.parts.first.attachment? #=> true\n@mail.parts.first.content_transfer_encoding.to_s #=> 'base64'\n@mail.attachments.first.mime_type #=> 'image/jpg'\n@mail.attachments.first.filename #=> 'file.jpg'\n@mail.attachments.first.decoded == File.read('/path/to/file.jpg') #=> true\n```\nOr You can pass in file_data and give it a filename, again, mail\nwill try and guess the mime_type for you.\n```ruby\n@mail = Mail.new\n@mail.attachments['myfile.pdf'] = File.read('path/to/myfile.pdf')\n@mail.parts.first.attachment? #=> true\n@mail.attachments.first.mime_type #=> 'application/pdf'\n@mail.attachments.first.decoded == File.read('path/to/myfile.pdf') #=> true\n```\nYou can also override the guessed MIME media type if you really know better\nthan mail (this should be rarely needed)\n```ruby\n@mail = Mail.new\n@mail.attachments['myfile.pdf'] = { :mime_type => 'application/x-pdf',\n                                    :content => File.read('path/to/myfile.pdf') }\n@mail.parts.first.mime_type #=> 'application/x-pdf'\n```\nOf course... Mail will round trip an attachment as well\n```ruby\n@mail = Mail.new do\n  to      'nicolas@test.lindsaar.net.au'\n  from    'Mikel Lindsaar <mikel@test.lindsaar.net.au>'\n  subject 'First multipart email sent with Mail'\n  text_part do\n    body 'Here is the attachment you wanted'\n  end\n  html_part do\n    content_type 'text/html; charset=UTF-8'\n    body '<h1>Funky Title</h1><p>Here is the attachment you wanted</p>'\n  end\n  add_file '/path/to/myfile.pdf'\nend\n@round_tripped_mail = Mail.new(@mail.encoded)\n@round_tripped_mail.attachments.length #=> 1\n@round_tripped_mail.attachments.first.filename #=> 'myfile.pdf'\n```\nSee \"Testing and extracting attachments\" above for more details.\n## Using Mail with Testing or Spec'ing Libraries\nIf mail is part of your system, you'll need a way to test it without actually\nsending emails, the TestMailer can do this for you.\n```ruby\nrequire 'mail'\n=> true\nMail.defaults do\n  delivery_method :test\nend\n=> #<Mail::Configuration:0x19345a8 @delivery_method=Mail::TestMailer>\nMail::TestMailer.deliveries\n=> []\nMail.deliver do\n  to 'mikel@me.com'\n  from 'you@you.com'\n  subject 'testing'\n  body 'hello'\nend\n=> #<Mail::Message:0x19284ec ...\nMail::TestMailer.deliveries.length\n=> 1\nMail::TestMailer.deliveries.first\n=> #<Mail::Message:0x19284ec ...\nMail::TestMailer.deliveries.clear\n=> []\n```\nThere is also a set of RSpec matchers stolen/inspired by Shoulda's ActionMailer matchers (you'll want to set <code>delivery_method</code> as above too):\n```ruby\nMail.defaults do\n  delivery_method :test # in practice you'd do this in spec_helper.rb\nend\ndescribe \"sending an email\" do\n  include Mail::Matchers\n  before(:each) do\n    Mail::TestMailer.deliveries.clear\n    Mail.deliver do\n      to ['mikel@me.com', 'mike2@me.com']\n      from 'you@you.com'\n      subject 'testing'\n      body 'hello'\n    end\n  end\n  it { is_expected.to have_sent_email } # passes if any email at all was sent\n  it { is_expected.to have_sent_email.from('you@you.com') }\n  it { is_expected.to have_sent_email.to('mike1@me.com') }\n  # can specify a list of recipients...\n  it { is_expected.to have_sent_email.to(['mike1@me.com', 'mike2@me.com']) }\n  # ...or chain recipients together\n  it { is_expected.to have_sent_email.to('mike1@me.com').to('mike2@me.com') }\n  it { is_expected.to have_sent_email.with_subject('testing') }\n  it { is_expected.to have_sent_email.with_body('hello') }\n  # Can match subject or body with a regex\n  # (or anything that responds_to? :match)\n  it { is_expected.to have_sent_email.matching_subject(/test(ing)?/) }\n  it { is_expected.to have_sent_email.matching_body(/h(a|e)llo/) }\n  # Can chain together modifiers\n  # Note that apart from recipients, repeating a modifier overwrites old value.\n  it { is_expected.to have_sent_email.from('you@you.com').to('mike1@me.com').matching_body(/hell/)\n  # test for attachments\n  # ... by specific attachment\n  it { is_expected.to have_sent_email.with_attachments(my_attachment) }\n  # ... or any attachment\n  it { is_expected.to have_sent_email.with_attachments(any_attachment) }\n  # ... by array of attachments\n  it { is_expected.to have_sent_email.with_attachments([my_attachment1, my_attachment2]) } #note that order is important\n  #... by presence\n  it { is_expected.to have_sent_email.with_any_attachments }\n  #... or by absence\n  it { is_expected.to have_sent_email.with_no_attachments }\nend\n```\n## Excerpts from TREC Spam Corpus 2005\nThe spec fixture files in spec/fixtures/emails/from_trec_2005 are from the\n2005 TREC Public Spam Corpus.

Also returns `Proc` and `Lambda` sourcecode.\nMethod comments can also be extracted using the `comment` method.\nIt is written in pure Ruby (no C).\n* Some Ruby 1.8 support now available.\n* Support for MRI, RBX, JRuby, REE\n`method_source` provides the `source` and `comment` methods to the `Method` and\n`UnboundMethod` and `Proc` classes.\n* Install the [gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/method_source): `gem install method_source`\n* Read the [documentation](https://www.rubydoc.info/github/banister/method_source/master)\n* See the [source code](http://github.com/banister/method_source)\nExample: display method source\n------------------------------\n    Set.instance_method(:merge).source.display\n    # =>\n    def merge(enum)\n      if enum.instance_of?(self.class)\n        @hash.update(enum.instance_variable_get(:@hash))\n      else\n        do_with_enum(enum) { |o| add(o) }\n      end\n      self\n    end\nExample: display method comments\n--------------------------------\n    Set.instance_method(:merge).comment.display\n    # =>\n    # Merges the elements of the given enumerable object to the set and\n    # returns self.\nLimitations:\n------------\n* Occasional strange behaviour in Ruby 1.8\n* Cannot return source for C methods.\n* Cannot return source for dynamically defined methods.\nSpecial Thanks\n--------------\n[Adam Sanderson](https://github.com/adamsanderson) for `comment` functionality.\n[Dmitry Elastic](https://github.com/dmitryelastic) for the brilliant Ruby 1.8 `source_location`

Net::HTTP::Persistent wraps Net::HTTP and allows you to\nfocus on how to make HTTP requests.\n== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:\n* Supports TLS with secure defaults\n* Thread-safe\n* Pure ruby\n== SYNOPSIS\nThe following example will make two requests to the same server.  The\nconnection is kept alive between requests:\n    require 'net/http/persistent'\n    uri = URI 'http://example.com/awesome/web/service'\n    http = Net::HTTP::Persistent.new name: 'my_app_name'\n    # perform a GET\n    response = http.request uri\n    # create a POST\n    post_uri = uri + 'create'\n    post = Net::HTTP::Post.new post_uri.path\n    post.set_form_data 'some' => 'cool data'\n    # perform the POST, the URI is always required\n    response = http.request post_uri, post\n    # if you are done making http requests, or won't make requests for several\n    # minutes\n    http.shutdown\nPlease see the documentation on Net::HTTP::Persistent for more information,\nincluding SSL connection verification, header handling and tunable options.\n== INSTALL:\n  gem install net-http-persistent\n== LICENSE:\n(The MIT License)\nCopyright (c) Eric Hodel, Aaron Patterson\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.","notice":""},{"name":"net-ldap","version":"0.16.3","licenses":["MIT"],"texts":"== License\nThis software is available under the terms of the MIT license.\nCopyright 2006â2011 by Francis Cianfrocca and other contributors.\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n\"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND\nNONINFRINGEMENT.

This operates over SSH (and requires the Net::SSH library), and allows files and directory trees to be copied to and from a remote server.\n== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:\n* Transfer files or entire directory trees to or from a remote host via SCP\n* Can preserve file attributes across transfers\n* Can download files in-memory, or direct-to-disk\n* Support for SCP URI's, and OpenURI\n== SYNOPSIS:\nIn a nutshell:\n  require 'net/scp'\n  # upload a file to a remote server\n  Net::SCP.upload!(\"remote.host.com\", \"username\",\n    \"/local/path\", \"/remote/path\",\n    :ssh => { :password => \"password\" })\n  \n  # upload recursively\n  Net::SCP.upload!(\"remote.host\", \"username\", \"/path/to/local\", \"/path/to/remote\",\n     :ssh => { :password => \"foo\" }, :recursive => true)\n  # download a file from a remote server\n  Net::SCP.download!(\"remote.host.com\", \"username\",\n    \"/remote/path\", \"/local/path\",\n    :ssh => { :password => \"password\" })\n  # download a file to an in-memory buffer\n  data = Net::SCP::download!(\"remote.host.com\", \"username\", \"/remote/path\")\n  # use a persistent connection to transfer files\n  Net::SCP.start(\"remote.host.com\", \"username\", :password => \"password\") do |scp|\n    # upload a file to a remote server\n    scp.upload! \"/local/path\", \"/remote/path\"\n    # upload from an in-memory buffer\n    scp.upload! StringIO.new(\"some data to upload\"), \"/remote/path\"\n    # run multiple downloads in parallel\n    d1 = scp.download(\"/remote/path\", \"/local/path\")\n    d2 = scp.download(\"/remote/path2\", \"/local/path2\")\n    [d1, d2].each { |d| d.wait }\n  end\n  # You can also use open-uri to grab data via scp:\n  require 'uri/open-scp'\n  data = open(\"scp://user@host/path/to/file.txt\").read\nFor more information, see Net::SCP.\n== REQUIREMENTS:\n* Net::SSH 2\nIf you wish to run the tests, you'll also need:\n* Echoe (for Rakefile use)\n* Mocha (for tests)\n== INSTALL:\n* gem install net-scp (might need sudo privileges)\nHowever, in order to be sure the code you're installing hasn't been tampered with, it's recommended that you verify the signature[http://docs.seattlerb.org/rubygems/Gem/Security.html]. To do this, you need to add my public key as a trusted certificate (you only need to do this once):\n    # Add the public key as a trusted certificate\n    # (You only need to do this once)\n    $ curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/net-ssh/net-ssh/master/net-ssh-public_cert.pem\n    $ gem cert --add net-ssh-public_cert.pem\nThen- when installing the gem - do so with high security:\n    $ gem install net-scp -P HighSecurity\nIf you don't add the public key, you'll see an error like \"Couldn't verify data signature\". If you're still having trouble let me know and I'll give you a hand.\nOr, you can do it the hard way (without Rubygems):\n* tar xzf net-scp-*.tgz\n* cd net-scp-*\n* ruby setup.rb config\n* ruby setup.rb install (might need sudo privileges)\n== LICENSE:\n(The MIT License)\nCopyright (c) 2008 Jamis Buck <jamis@37signals.com>\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.","notice":""},{"name":"net-ssh","version":"6.0.0","licenses":["MIT"],"texts":"Copyright Â© 2008 Jamis Buck\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\nthis software and associated documentation files (the âSoftwareâ), to deal in\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies\nof the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do\nso, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED âAS ISâ, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

servers, via SSH2.\n## FEATURES:\n* Execute processes on remote servers and capture their output\n* Run multiple processes in parallel over a single SSH connection\n* Support for SSH subsystems\n* Forward local and remote ports via an SSH connection\n## Supported Algorithms\nNet::SSH 6.0 disables by default the usage of weak algorithms.\nWe strongly recommend that you install a servers's version that supports the latest algorithms.\nIt is possible to return to the previous behavior by adding the option : `append_all_supported_algorithms: true`\nUnsecure algoritms will be definively remove in Net::SSH 7.*.\n### Host Keys\n| Name                 | Support               | Details  |\n|----------------------|-----------------------|----------|\n| ssh-rsa              | OK

\"www.capify.org\", 80)\nssh.loop { true }\nend\n```\nSee Net::SSH for more documentation, and links to further information.\n## REQUIREMENTS:\nThe only requirement you might be missing is the OpenSSL bindings for Ruby with a version greather than `1.0.1`.\nThese are built by default on most platforms, but you can verify that they're built and installed on your system by running the following command line:\n```sh\nruby -ropenssl -e 'puts OpenSSL::OPENSSL_VERSION'\n```\nIf that spits out something like `OpenSSL 1.0.1 14 Mar 2012`, then you're set.\nIf you get an error, then you'll need to see about rebuilding ruby with OpenSSL support,\nor (if your platform supports it) installing the OpenSSL bindings separately.\n## INSTALL:\n```sh\ngem install net-ssh # might need sudo privileges\n```\nNOTE: If you are running on jruby on windows you need to install `jruby-pageant` manually\n(gemspec doesn't allow for platform specific dependencies).\nHowever, in order to be sure the code you're installing hasn't been tampered with,\nit's recommended that you verify the [signature](http://docs.rubygems.org/read/chapter/21).\n To do this, you need to add my public key as a trusted certificate (you only need to do this once):\n```sh\n# Add the public key as a trusted certificate\n# (You only need to do this once)\ncurl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/net-ssh/net-ssh/master/net-ssh-public_cert.pem\ngem cert --add net-ssh-public_cert.pem\n```\nThen, when install the gem, do so with high security:\n```sh\ngem install net-ssh -P HighSecurity\n```\nIf you don't add the public key, you'll see an error like \"Couldn't verify data signature\".\nIf you're still having trouble let me know and I'll give you a hand.\nFor ed25519 public key auth support your bundle file should contain `ed25519`, `bcrypt_pbkdf` dependencies.\n```sh\ngem install ed25519\ngem install bcrypt_pbkdf\n```\nFor curve25519-sha256 kex exchange support your bundle file should contain `x25519` dependency.\n## RUBY SUPPORT\n* See [net-ssh.gemspec](https://github.com/net-ssh/net-ssh/blob/master/net-ssh.gemspec) for current versions ruby requirements\n## RUNNING TESTS\nIf you want to run the tests or use any of the Rake tasks, you'll need Mocha and\nother dependencies listed in Gemfile\nRun the test suite from the net-ssh directory with the following command:\n```sh\nbundle exec rake test\n```\nRun a single test file like this:\n```sh\nruby -Ilib -Itest test/transport/test_server_version.rb\n```\nTo run integration tests see test/integration/README.txt\n### BUILDING GEM\n```sh\nrake build\n```\n### GEM SIGNING (for maintainers)\nIf you have the net-ssh private signing key, you will be able to create signed release builds. Make sure the private key path matches the `signing_key` path set in `net-ssh.gemspec` and tell rake to sign the gem by setting the `NET_SSH_BUILDGEM_SIGNED` flag:\n```sh\nNET_SSH_BUILDGEM_SIGNED=true rake build\n```\nFor time to time, the public certificate associated to the private key needs to be renewed. You can do this with the following command:\n```sh\ngem cert --build netssh@solutious.com --private-key path/2/net-ssh-private_key.pem\nmv gem-public_cert.pem net-ssh-public_cert.pem\ngem cert --add net-ssh-public_cert.pem\n```\n## CREDITS\n### Contributors\nThis project exists thanks to all the people who contribute.\n[![contributors](https://opencollective.com/net-ssh/contributors.svg?width=890&button=false)](graphs/contributors)\n### Backers\nThank you to all our backers! ð [Become a backer](https://opencollective.com/net-ssh#backer)\n[![backers](https://opencollective.com/net-ssh/backers.svg?width=890)](https://opencollective.com/net-ssh#backers)\n### Sponsors\nSupport this project by becoming a sponsor.

Modeled after the Java NIO API, but\nsimplified for ease-of-use.\n**nio4r** provides an abstract, cross-platform stateful I/O selector API for Ruby.\nI/O selectors are the heart of \"reactor\"-based event loops, and monitor\nmultiple I/O objects for various types of readiness, e.g. ready for reading or\nwriting.\n## Projects using nio4r\n* [ActionCable]: Rails 5 WebSocket protocol, uses nio4r for a WebSocket server\n* [Celluloid]: Actor-based concurrency framework, uses nio4r for async I/O\n* [Async]: Asynchronous I/O framework for Ruby\n* [Puma]: Ruby/Rack web server built for concurrency\n[ActionCable]: https://rubygems.org/gems/actioncable\n[Celluloid]: https://github.com/celluloid/celluloid-io\n[Async]: https://github.com/socketry/async\n[Puma]: https://github.com/puma/puma\n## Goals\n* Expose high-level interfaces for stateful IO selectors\n* Keep the API small to maximize both portability and performance across many\n  different OSes and Ruby VMs\n* Provide inherently thread-safe facilities for working with IO objects\n## Supported platforms\n* Ruby 2.4\n* Ruby 2.5\n* Ruby 2.6\n* Ruby 2.7\n* Ruby 3.0\n* [JRuby](https://github.com/jruby/jruby)\n* [TruffleRuby](https://github.com/oracle/truffleruby)\n## Supported backends\n* **libev**: MRI C extension targeting multiple native IO selector APIs (e.g epoll, kqueue)\n* **Java NIO**: JRuby extension which wraps the Java NIO subsystem\n* **Pure Ruby**: `Kernel.select`-based backend that should work on any Ruby interpreter\n## Documentation\n[Please see the nio4r wiki](https://github.com/socketry/nio4r/wiki)\nfor more detailed documentation and usage notes:\n* [Getting Started]: Introduction to nio4r's components\n* [Selectors]: monitor multiple `IO` objects for readiness events\n* [Monitors]: control interests and inspect readiness for specific `IO` objects\n* [Byte Buffers]: fixed-size native buffers for high-performance I/O\n[Getting Started]: https://github.com/socketry/nio4r/wiki/Getting-Started\n[Selectors]: https://github.com/socketry/nio4r/wiki/Selectors\n[Monitors]: https://github.com/socketry/nio4r/wiki/Monitors\n[Byte Buffers]: https://github.com/socketry/nio4r/wiki/Byte-Buffers\nSee also:\n* [YARD API documentation](http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/nio4r/frames)\n## Non-goals\n**nio4r** is not a full-featured event framework like [EventMachine] or [Cool.io].\nInstead, nio4r is the sort of thing you might write a library like that on\ntop of. nio4r provides a minimal API such that individual Ruby implementers\nmay choose to produce optimized versions for their platform, without having\nto maintain a large codebase.\n[EventMachine]: https://github.com/eventmachine/eventmachine\n[Cool.io]: https://coolio.github.io/\n## Releases\n### CRuby\n```\nrake clean\nrake release\n```\n### JRuby\nYou might need to delete `Gemfile.lock` before trying to `bundle install`.\n```\nrake clean\nrake compile\nrake release\n```\n## License\nReleased under the MIT license.\nCopyright, 2019, by Tony Arcieri.  \nCopyright, 2019, by [Samuel G.

It is\n     numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]\n    \n    \t\t\t    Preamble\n    \n      The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\n    freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\n    Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\n    free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n    \n      This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some\n    specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any\n    other libraries whose authors decide to use it.  You can use it for\n    your libraries, too.\n    \n      When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\n    price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\n    have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\n    this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\n    if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\n    in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n    \n      To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\n    anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\n    These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if\n    you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.\n    \n      For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\n    or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\n    you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\n    code.  If you link a program with the library, you must provide\n    complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them\n    with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling\n    it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n    \n      Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright\n    the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal\n    permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\n    \n      Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain\n    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\n    library.  If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we\n    want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original\n    version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on\n    the original authors' reputations.\n    \f\n      Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\n    patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free\n    software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect\n    transforming the program into proprietary software.  To prevent this,\n    we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's\n    free use or not licensed at all.\n    \n      Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary\n    GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.  This\n    license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain\n    designated libraries.  This license is quite different from the ordinary\n    one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is\n    the same as in the ordinary license.\n    \n      The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that\n    they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a\n    program and simply using it.  Linking a program with a library, without\n    changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is\n    analogous to running a utility program or application program.  However, in\n    a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a\n    derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License\n    treats it as such.\n    \n      Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General\n    Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software\n    sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.  We\n    concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.\n    \n      However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the\n    users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the\n    libraries themselves.  This Library General Public License is intended to\n    permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while\n    preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free\n    libraries that are incorporated in them.  (We have not seen how to achieve\n    this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards\n    changes in the actual functions of the Library.)  The hope is that this\n    will lead to faster development of free libraries.\n    \n      The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\n    modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\n    \"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The\n    former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only\n    works together with the library.\n    \n      Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary\n    General Public License rather than by this special one.\n    \f\n    \t\t  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n       TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n    \n      0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which\n    contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized\n    party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library\n    General Public License (also called \"this License\").  Each licensee is\n    addressed as \"you\".\n    \n      A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data\n    prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\n    (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\n    \n      The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work\n    which has been distributed under these terms.  A \"work based on the\n    Library\" means either the Library or any derivative work under\n    copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\n    portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\n    straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\n    included without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n    \n      \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\n    making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\n    all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\n    interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation\n    and installation of the library.\n    \n      Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\n    covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\n    running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\n    such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\n    on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\n    writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\n    and what the program that uses the Library does.\n      \n      1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\n    complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\n    you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\n    appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\n    all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\n    warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\n    Library.\n    \n      You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\n    and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\n    fee.\n    \f\n      2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\n    of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\n    distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\n    above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n    \n        a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\n    \n        b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\n        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n    \n        c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\n        charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n    \n        d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\n        table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\n        the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\n        is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\n        in the event an application does not supply such function or\n        table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\n        its purpose remains meaningful.\n    \n        (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\n        a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\n        application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\n        application-supplied function or table used by this function must\n        be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\n        root function must still compute square roots.)\n    \n    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\n    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\n    and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\n    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\n    sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\n    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\n    on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\n    this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\n    entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\n    it.\n    \n    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\n    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\n    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\n    collective works based on the Library.\n    \n    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\n    with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\n    a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\n    the scope of this License.\n    \n      3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\n    License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\n    this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\n    that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\n    instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\n    ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\n    that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\n    these notices.\n    \f\n      Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\n    that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\n    subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\n    \n      This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\n    the Library into a program that is not a library.\n    \n      4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\n    derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\n    under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\n    it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\n    must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\n    medium customarily used for software interchange.\n    \n      If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\n    from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\n    source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\n    distribute the source code, even though third parties are not\n    compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n    \n      5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\n    Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\n    linked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".  Such a\n    work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\n    therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n    \n      However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library\n    creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\n    contains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the\n    library\".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\n    Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\n    \n      When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file\n    that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\n    derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\n    Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\n    linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\n    threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\n    \n      If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\n    structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\n    functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\n    file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\n    work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\n    Library will still fall under Section 6.)\n    \n      Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\n    distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\n    Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\n    whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\n    \f\n      6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or\n    link a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a\n    work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\n    under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\n    modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\n    engineering for debugging such modifications.\n    \n      You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\n    Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\n    this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\n    during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\n    copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\n    directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\n    of these things:\n    \n        a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\n        machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\n        changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\n        Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\n        with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that\n        uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the\n        user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\n        executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\n        that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\n        Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\n        to use the modified definitions.)\n    \n        b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at\n        least three years, to give the same user the materials\n        specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more\n        than the cost of performing this distribution.\n    \n        c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\n        from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\n        specified materials from the same place.\n    \n        d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\n        materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\n    \n      For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the\n    Library\" must include any data and utility programs needed for\n    reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\n    the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally\n    distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\n    components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\n    which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\n    the executable.\n    \n      It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\n    restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\n    accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\n    use both them and the Library together in an executable that you\n    distribute.\n    \f\n      7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\n    Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library\n    facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\n    library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\n    the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\n    permitted, and provided that you do these two things:\n    \n        a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\n        based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\n        facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\n        Sections above.\n    \n        b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\n        that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\n        where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n    \n      8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\n    the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\n    attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\n    distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\n    rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\n    or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\n    terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n    \n      9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\n    signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\n    distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\n    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\n    modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\n    Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\n    all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\n    the Library or works based on it.\n    \n      10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\n    Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\n    original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\n    subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\n    restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\n    You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\n    this License.\n    \f\n      11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\n    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\n    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\n    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\n    excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\n    distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\n    License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\n    may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\n    license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\n    all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\n    the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\n    refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\n    \n    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\n    particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,\n    and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\n    \n    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\n    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\n    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\n    integrity of the free software distribution system which is\n    implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\n    generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\n    through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\n    system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\n    to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\n    impose that choice.\n    \n    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\n    be a consequence of the rest of this License.\n    \n      12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\n    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\n    original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add\n    an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,\n    so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus\n    excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if\n    written in the body of this License.\n    \n      13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\n    versions of the Library General Public License from time to time.\n    Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\n    but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n    \n    Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\n    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\n    \"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\n    conditions either of that version or of any later version published by\n    the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\n    license version number, you may choose any version ever published by\n    the Free Software Foundation.\n    \f\n      14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\n    programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\n    write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\n    copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\n    Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\n    decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\n    of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\n    and reuse of software generally.\n    \n    \t\t\t    NO WARRANTY\n    \n      15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\n    WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\n    EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\n    OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\n    KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\n    IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\n    PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\n    LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\n    THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n    \n      16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\n    WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\n    AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\n    FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\n    CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\n    LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\n    RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\n    FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\n    SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\n    DAMAGES.\n    \n    \t\t     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n    \f\n         Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\n    \n      If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\n    possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\n    everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\n    redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the\n    ordinary General Public License).\n    \n      To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is\n    safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\n    convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the\n    \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n    \n        <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n        Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n    \n        This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\n        modify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public\n        License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\n        version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n    \n        This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n        but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n        MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU\n        Library General Public License for more details.\n    \n        You should have received a copy of the GNU Library General Public\n        License along with this library; if not, write to the Free\n        Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston,\n        MA 02110-1301, USA\n    \n    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n    \n    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\n    school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the library, if\n    necessary.

Definitions.\n    \n          \"License\" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,\n          and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.\n    \n          \"Licensor\" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by\n          the copyright owner that is granting the License.\n    \n          \"Legal Entity\" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all\n          other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common\n          control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,\n          \"control\" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the\n          direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or\n          otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the\n          outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.\n    \n          \"You\" (or \"Your\") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity\n          exercising permissions granted by this License.\n    \n          \"Source\" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,\n          including but not limited to software source code, documentation\n          source, and configuration files.\n    \n          \"Object\" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical\n          transformation or translation of a Source form, including but\n          not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,\n          and conversions to other media types.\n    \n          \"Work\" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or\n          Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a\n          copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work\n          (an example is provided in the Appendix below).\n    \n          \"Derivative Works\" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object\n          form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the\n          editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications\n          represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.

You may add Your own attribution\n              notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n              or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n              that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n              as modifying the License.\n    \n          You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n          may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n          for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n          for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n          reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n          the conditions stated in this License.\n    \n       5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n          any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n          by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n          this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n          Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n          the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n          with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n    \n       6. Trademarks.

Octokit.rb wraps the [GitHub API][github-api] in a flat API\nclient that follows Ruby conventions and requires little knowledge of REST.\nMost methods have positional arguments for required input and an options hash\nfor optional parameters, headers, or other options:\n```ruby\nclient = Octokit::Client.new\n# Fetch a README with Accept header for HTML format\nclient.readme 'al3x/sovereign', :accept => 'application/vnd.github.html'\n```\n[wrappers]: http://wynnnetherland.com/journal/what-makes-a-good-api-wrapper\n[github-api]: https://developer.github.com/v3/\n## Installation\nInstall via Rubygems\n    gem install octokit\n... or add to your Gemfile\n    gem \"octokit\", \"~> 4.0\"\nAccess the library in Ruby:\n    require 'octokit'\n## Making requests\n[API methods][] are available as client instance methods.\n```ruby\n# Provide authentication credentials\nclient = Octokit::Client.new(:access_token => 'personal_access_token')\n# You can still use the username/password syntax by replacing the password value with your PAT.\n# client = Octokit::Client.new(:login => 'defunkt', :password => 'personal_access_token')\n# Fetch the current user\nclient.user\n```\n### Additional query parameters\nWhen passing additional parameters to GET based request use the following syntax:\n```ruby\n # query: { parameter_name: 'value' }\n # Example: Get repository listing by owner in ascending order\n client.repos({}, query: {type: 'owner', sort: 'asc'})\n # Example: Get contents of a repository by ref\n # https://api.github.com/repos/octokit/octokit.rb/contents/path/to/file.rb?ref=some-other-branch\n client.contents('octokit/octokit.rb', path: 'path/to/file.rb', query: {ref: 'some-other-branch'})\n```\n[api methods]: http://octokit.github.io/octokit.rb/method_list.html\n## Consuming resources\nMost methods return a `Resource` object which provides dot notation and `[]`\naccess for fields returned in the API response.\n```ruby\nclient = Octokit::Client.new\n# Fetch a user\nuser = client.user 'jbarnette'\nputs user.name\n# => \"John Barnette\"\nputs user.fields\n# => <Set: {:login, :id, :gravatar_id, :type, :name, :company, :blog, :location, :email, :hireable, :bio, :public_repos, :followers, :following, :created_at, :updated_at, :public_gists}>\nputs user[:company]\n# => \"GitHub\"\nuser.rels[:gists].href\n# => \"https://api.github.com/users/jbarnette/gists\"\n```\n**Note:** URL fields are culled into a separate `.rels` collection for easier\n[Hypermedia](#hypermedia-agent) support.\n## Accessing HTTP responses\nWhile most methods return a `Resource` object or a Boolean, sometimes you may\nneed access to the raw HTTP response headers. You can access the last HTTP\nresponse with `Client#last_response`:\n```ruby\nuser      = client.user 'andrewpthorp'\nresponse  = client.last_response\netag      = response.headers[:etag]\n```\n## Handling errors\nWhen the API returns an error response, Octokit will raise a Ruby exception.\nA range of different exceptions can be raised depending on the error returned\nby the API - for example:\n* A `400 Bad Request` response will lead to an `Octokit::BadRequest` error \n* A `403 Forbidden` error with a \"rate limited exceeded\" message will lead\n  to a `Octokit::TooManyRequests` error\nAll of the different exception classes inherit from `Octokit::Error` and\nexpose the `#response_status`, `#response_headers` and `#response_body`.\nFor validation errors, `#errors` will return an `Array` of `Hash`es\nwith the detailed information\n[returned by the API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api#client-errors).\n## Authentication\nOctokit supports the various [authentication methods supported by the GitHub\nAPI][auth]:\n### Basic Authentication\nUsing your GitHub username and password is the easiest way to get started\nmaking authenticated requests:\n```ruby\nclient = Octokit::Client.new(:login => 'defunkt', :password => 'c0d3b4ssssss!')\nuser = client.user\nuser.login\n# => \"defunkt\"\n```\nWhile Basic Authentication allows you to get started quickly, OAuth access\ntokens are the preferred way to authenticate on behalf of users.\n### OAuth access tokens\n[OAuth access tokens][oauth] provide two main benefits over using your username\nand password:\n- **Revocable access**. Access tokens can be revoked, removing access for only\n  that token without having to change your password everywhere.\n- **Limited access**. Access tokens have [access scopes][] which allow for more\n  granular access to API resources. For instance, you can grant a third party\n  access to your gists but not your private repositories.\nTo use an access token with the Octokit client, pass your token in the\n`:access_token` options parameter in lieu of your username and password:\n```ruby\nclient = Octokit::Client.new(:access_token => \"<your 40 char token>\")\nuser = client.user\nuser.login\n# => \"defunkt\"\n```\nYou can [create access tokens through your GitHub Account Settings](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use)\nor with a basic authenticated Octokit client:\n```ruby\nclient = Octokit::Client.new(:login => 'defunkt', :password => 'c0d3b4ssssss!')\nclient.create_authorization(:scopes => [\"user\"], :note => \"Name of token\")\n# => <your new oauth token>\n```\n### Two-Factor Authentication\n[Two-Factor Authentication](https://help.github.com/articles/about-two-factor-authentication) brings added security to the account by requiring more information to login.\nUsing two-factor authentication for API calls is as simple as adding the [required header](http://developer.github.com/v3/auth/#working-with-two-factor-authentication) as an option:\n```ruby\nclient = Octokit::Client.new \\\n  :login    => 'defunkt',\n  :password => 'c0d3b4ssssss!'\nuser = client.user(\"defunkt\", :headers => { \"X-GitHub-OTP\" => \"<your 2FA token>\" })\n```\nAs you can imagine, this gets annoying quickly since two-factor auth tokens are very short lived. So it is recommended to create an oauth token for the user to communicate with the API:\n```ruby\nclient = Octokit::Client.new \\\n  :login    => 'defunkt',\n  :password => 'c0d3b4ssssss!'\nclient.create_authorization(:scopes => [\"user\"], :note => \"Name of token\",\n                            :headers => { \"X-GitHub-OTP\" => \"<your 2FA token>\" })\n# => <your new oauth token>\n```\n### Using a .netrc file\nOctokit supports reading credentials from a netrc file (defaulting to\n`~/.netrc`). Given these lines in your netrc:\n```\nmachine api.github.com\n  login defunkt\n  password c0d3b4ssssss!\n```\nYou can now create a client with those credentials:\n```ruby\nclient = Octokit::Client.new(:netrc => true)\nclient.login\n# => \"defunkt\"\n```\nBut _I want to use OAuth_ you say. Since the GitHub API supports using an OAuth\ntoken as a Basic password, you totally can:\n```\nmachine api.github.com\n  login defunkt\n  password <your 40 char token>\n```\n**Note:** Support for netrc requires adding the [netrc gem][] to your Gemfile\nor `.gemspec`.\n### Application authentication\nOctokit also supports application-only authentication [using OAuth application client\ncredentials][app-creds]. Using application credentials will result in making\nanonymous API calls on behalf of an application in order to take advantage of\nthe higher rate limit.\n```ruby\nclient = Octokit::Client.new \\\n  :client_id     => \"<your 20 char id>\",\n  :client_secret => \"<your 40 char secret>\"\nuser = client.user 'defunkt'\n```\n[auth]: http://developer.github.com/v3/#authentication\n[oauth]: http://developer.github.com/v3/oauth/\n[access scopes]: http://developer.github.com/v3/oauth/#scopes\n[app-creds]: http://developer.github.com/v3/#increasing-the-unauthenticated-rate-limit-for-oauth-applications\n## Default results per_page\nDefault results from the GitHub API are 30, if you wish to add more you must do so during Octokit configuration.\n```ruby\nOctokit::Client.new(access_token: \"<your 40 char token>\", per_page: 100)\n```\n## Pagination\nMany GitHub API resources are [paginated][]. While you may be tempted to start\nadding `:page` parameters to your calls, the API returns links to the next,\nprevious, and last pages for you in the `Link` response header as [Hypermedia\nlink relations](#hypermedia-agent).\n```ruby\nissues = client.issues 'rails/rails'\nissues.concat client.get(client.last_response.rels[:next].href)\n```\n### Auto pagination\nFor smallish resource lists, Octokit provides auto pagination. When this is\nenabled, calls for paginated resources will fetch and concatenate the results\nfrom every page into a single array:\n```ruby\nclient.auto_paginate = true\nissues = client.issues 'rails/rails'\nissues.length\n# => 702\n```\nYou can also enable auto pagination for all Octokit client instances:\n```ruby\nOctokit.configure do |c|\n  c.auto_paginate = true\nend\n```\n**Note:** While Octokit auto pagination will set the page size to the maximum\n`100`, and seek to not overstep your rate limit, you probably want to use a\ncustom pattern for traversing large lists.\n[paginated]: http://developer.github.com/v3/#pagination\n## Working with GitHub Enterprise\nWith a bit of setup, you can also use Octokit with your GitHub Enterprise instance.\n### Interacting with the GitHub.com APIs in GitHub Enterprise\nTo interact with the \"regular\" GitHub.com APIs in GitHub Enterprise, simply configure the `api_endpoint` to match your hostname. For example:\n```ruby\nOctokit.configure do |c|\n  c.api_endpoint = \"https://<hostname>/api/v3/\"\nend\nclient = Octokit::Client.new(:access_token => \"<your 40 char token>\")\n```\n### Interacting with the GitHub Enterprise Admin APIs\nThe GitHub Enterprise Admin APIs are under a different client: `EnterpriseAdminClient`. You'll need to have an administrator account in order to use these APIs.\n```ruby\nadmin_client = Octokit::EnterpriseAdminClient.new(\n  :access_token => \"<your 40 char token>\",\n  :api_endpoint => \"https://<hostname>/api/v3/\"\n)\n# or\nOctokit.configure do |c|\n  c.api_endpoint = \"https://<hostname>/api/v3/\"\n  c.access_token = \"<your 40 char token>\"\nend\nadmin_client = Octokit.enterprise_admin_client.new\n```\n### Interacting with the GitHub Enterprise Management Console APIs\nThe GitHub Enterprise Management Console APIs are also under a separate client: `EnterpriseManagementConsoleClient`. In order to use it, you'll need to provide both your management console password as well as the endpoint to your management console. This is different from the API endpoint provided above.\n```ruby\nmanagement_console_client = Octokit::EnterpriseManagementConsoleClient.new(\n  :management_console_password => \"secret\",\n  :management_console_endpoint = \"https://hostname:8633\"\n)\n# or\nOctokit.configure do |c|\n  c.management_console_endpoint = \"https://hostname:8633\"\n  c.management_console_password = \"secret\"\nend\nmanagement_console_client = Octokit.enterprise_management_console_client.new\n```\n### SSL Connection Errors\nYou _may_ need to disable SSL temporarily while first setting up your GitHub Enterprise install. You can do that with the following configuration:\n```ruby\nclient.connection_options[:ssl] = { :verify => false }\n```\nDo remember to turn `:verify` back to `true`, as it's important for secure communication.\n## Configuration and defaults\nWhile `Octokit::Client` accepts a range of options when creating a new client\ninstance, Octokit's configuration API allows you to set your configuration\noptions at the module level. This is particularly handy if you're creating a\nnumber of client instances based on some shared defaults. Changing options\naffects new instances only and will not modify existing `Octokit::Client`\ninstances created with previous options.\n### Configuring module defaults\nEvery writable attribute in {Octokit::Configurable} can be set one at a time:\n```ruby\nOctokit.api_endpoint = 'http://api.github.dev'\nOctokit.web_endpoint = 'http://github.dev'\n```\nor in batch:\n```ruby\nOctokit.configure do |c|\n  c.api_endpoint = 'http://api.github.dev'\n  c.web_endpoint = 'http://github.dev'\nend\n```\n### Using ENV variables\nDefault configuration values are specified in {Octokit::Default}. Many\nattributes will look for a default value from the ENV before returning\nOctokit's default.\n```ruby\n# Given $OCTOKIT_API_ENDPOINT is \"http://api.github.dev\"\nclient.api_endpoint\n# => \"http://api.github.dev\"\n```\nDeprecation warnings and API endpoints in development preview warnings are\nprinted to STDOUT by default, these can be disabled by setting the ENV\n`OCTOKIT_SILENT=true`.\n### Timeouts\nBy default, Octokit does not timeout network requests. To set a timeout, pass in Faraday timeout settings to Octokit's `connection_options` setting.\n```ruby\nOctokit.configure do |c|\n  c.api_endpoint = ENV.fetch('GITHUB_API_ENDPOINT', 'https://api.github.com/')\n  c.connection_options = {\n    request: {\n      open_timeout: 5,\n      timeout: 5\n    }\n  }\nend\n```\nYou should set a timeout in order to avoid Rubyâs Timeout module, which can hose your server. Here are some resources for more information on this:\n- [The Oldest Bug In Ruby - Why Rack::Timeout Might Hose your Server](https://www.schneems.com/2017/02/21/the-oldest-bug-in-ruby-why-racktimeout-might-hose-your-server/)\n- [Timeout: Ruby's Most Dangerous API](https://www.mikeperham.com/2015/05/08/timeout-rubys-most-dangerous-api/)\n- [The Ultimate Guide to Ruby Timeouts](https://github.com/ankane/the-ultimate-guide-to-ruby-timeouts)\n## Hypermedia agent\nStarting in version 2.0, Octokit is [hypermedia][]-enabled. Under the hood,\n{Octokit::Client} uses [Sawyer][], a hypermedia client built on [Faraday][].\n### Hypermedia in Octokit\nResources returned by Octokit methods contain not only data but hypermedia\nlink relations:\n```ruby\nuser = client.user 'technoweenie'\n# Get the repos rel, returned from the API\n# as repos_url in the resource\nuser.rels[:repos].href\n# => \"https://api.github.com/users/technoweenie/repos\"\nrepos = user.rels[:repos].get.data\nrepos.last.name\n# => \"faraday-zeromq\"\n```\nWhen processing API responses, all `*_url` attributes are culled into the link\nrelations collection. Any `url` attribute becomes `.rels[:self]`.\n### URI templates\nYou might notice many link relations have variable placeholders. Octokit\nsupports [URI Templates][uri-templates] for parameterized URI expansion:\n```ruby\nrepo = client.repo 'pengwynn/pingwynn'\nrel = repo.rels[:issues]\n# => #<Sawyer::Relation: issues: get https://api.github.com/repos/pengwynn/pingwynn/issues{/number}>\n# Get a page of issues\nrel.get.data\n# Get issue #2\nrel.get(:uri => {:number => 2}).data\n```\n### The Full Hypermedia Experienceâ¢\nIf you want to use Octokit as a pure hypermedia API client, you can start at\nthe API root and follow link relations from there:\n```ruby\nroot = client.root\nroot.rels[:repository].get :uri => {:owner => \"octokit\", :repo => \"octokit.rb\" }\nroot.rels[:user_repositories].get :uri => { :user => \"octokit\" },\n                                  :query => { :type => \"owner\" }\n```\nOctokit 3.0 aims to be hypermedia-driven, removing the internal URL\nconstruction currently used throughout the client.\n[hypermedia]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypermedia\n[sawyer]: https://github.com/lostisland/sawyer\n[faraday]: https://github.com/lostisland/faraday\n[uri-templates]: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6570\n## Upgrading guide\nVersion 4.0\n- **removes support for a [long-deprecated overload][list-pulls] for\n  passing state as a positional argument** when listing pull requests. Instead,\n  pass `state` in the method options.\n- **drops support for Ruby < 2.0**.\n- adds support for new [Enterprise-only APIs](#working-with-github-enterprise).\n- adds support for [Repository redirects][redirects].\n[list-pulls]: https://github.com/octokit/octokit.rb/commit/e48e91f736d5fce51e3bf74d7c9022aaa52f5c5c\n[redirects]: https://developer.github.com/changes/2015-05-26-repository-redirects-are-coming/\nVersion 3.0 includes a couple breaking changes when upgrading from v2.x.x:\nThe [default media type][default-media-type] is now `v3` instead of `beta`. If\nyou need to request the older media type, you can set the default media type\nfor the client:\n```ruby\nOctokit.default_media_type = \"application/vnd.github.beta+json\"\n```\nor per-request\n```ruby\nclient.emails(:accept => \"application/vnd.github.beta+json\")\n```\nThe long-deprecated `Octokit::Client#create_download` method has been removed.\n[default-media-type]: https://developer.github.com/changes/2014-01-07-upcoming-change-to-default-media-type/\n### Upgrading from 1.x.x\nVersion 2.0 includes a completely rewritten `Client` factory that now memoizes\nclient instances based on unique configuration options. Breaking changes also\ninclude:\n- `:oauth_token` is now `:access_token`\n- `:auto_traversal` is now `:auto_paginate`\n- `Hashie::Mash` has been removed. Responses now return a `Sawyer::Resource`\n  object. This new type behaves mostly like a Ruby `Hash`, but does not fully\n  support the `Hashie::Mash` API.\n- Two new client error types are raised where appropriate:\n  `Octokit::TooManyRequests` and `Octokit::TooManyLoginAttempts`\n- The `search_*` methods from v1.x are now found at `legacy_search_*`\n- Support for netrc requires including the [netrc gem][] in your Gemfile or\n  gemspec.\n- DateTime fields are now proper `DateTime` objects. Previous versions outputted DateTime fields as 'String' objects.\n[netrc gem]: https://rubygems.org/gems/netrc\n## Advanced usage\nSince Octokit employs [Faraday][faraday] under the hood, some behavior can be\nextended via middleware.\n### Debugging\nOften, it helps to know what Octokit is doing under the hood. You can add a\nlogger to the middleware that enables you to peek into the underlying HTTP\ntraffic:\n```ruby\nstack = Faraday::RackBuilder.new do |builder|\n  builder.use Faraday::Retry::Middleware, exceptions: [Octokit::ServerError] # or Faraday::Request::Retry for Faraday < 2.0\n  builder.use Octokit::Middleware::FollowRedirects\n  builder.use Octokit::Response::RaiseError\n  builder.use Octokit::Response::FeedParser\n  builder.response :logger do |logger|\n    logger.filter(/(Authorization: \"(token|Bearer) )(\\w+)/, '\\1[REMOVED]')\n  end\n  builder.adapter Faraday.default_adapter\nend\nOctokit.middleware = stack\nclient = Octokit::Client.new\nclient.user 'pengwynn'\n```\n```\nI, [2013-08-22T15:54:38.583300 #88227]  INFO -- : get https://api.github.com/users/pengwynn\nD, [2013-08-22T15:54:38.583401 #88227] DEBUG -- request: Accept: \"application/vnd.github.beta+json\"\nUser-Agent: \"Octokit Ruby Gem 2.0.0.rc4\"\nI, [2013-08-22T15:54:38.843313 #88227]  INFO -- Status: 200\nD, [2013-08-22T15:54:38.843459 #88227] DEBUG -- response: server: \"GitHub.com\"\ndate: \"Thu, 22 Aug 2013 20:54:40 GMT\"\ncontent-type: \"application/json; charset=utf-8\"\ntransfer-encoding: \"chunked\"\nconnection: \"close\"\nstatus: \"200 OK\"\nx-ratelimit-limit: \"60\"\nx-ratelimit-remaining: \"39\"\nx-ratelimit-reset: \"1377205443\"\n...\n```\nSee the [Faraday README][faraday] for more middleware magic.\n### Caching\nIf you want to boost performance, stretch your API rate limit, or avoid paying\nthe hypermedia tax, you can use [Faraday Http Cache][cache].\nAdd the gem to your Gemfile\n    gem 'faraday-http-cache'\nNext, construct your own Faraday middleware:\n```ruby\nstack = Faraday::RackBuilder.new do |builder|\n  builder.use Faraday::HttpCache, serializer: Marshal, shared_cache: false\n  builder.use Octokit::Response::RaiseError\n  builder.adapter Faraday.default_adapter\nend\nOctokit.middleware = stack\n```\nOnce configured, the middleware will store responses in cache based on ETag\nfingerprint and serve those back up for future `304` responses for the same\nresource. See the [project README][cache] for advanced usage.\n[cache]: https://github.com/plataformatec/faraday-http-cache\n[faraday]: https://github.com/lostisland/faraday\n## Hacking on Octokit.rb\nIf you want to hack on Octokit locally, we try to make [bootstrapping the\nproject][bootstrapping] as painless as possible. To start hacking, clone and run:\n    script/bootstrap\nThis will install project dependencies and get you up and running. If you want\nto run a Ruby console to poke on Octokit, you can crank one up with:\n    script/console\nUsing the scripts in `./script` instead of `bundle exec rspec`, `bundle console`, etc. ensures your dependencies are up-to-date.\n### Code of Conduct\nWe want both the Octokit.rb and larger Octokit communities to be open\nand welcoming environments. Please read and follow both in spirit and\nletter [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\n### Running and writing new tests\nOctokit uses [VCR][] for recording and playing back API fixtures during test\nruns. These cassettes (fixtures) are part of the Git project in the `spec/cassettes`\nfolder. If you're not recording new cassettes you can run the specs with existing\ncassettes with:\n    script/test\nOctokit uses environmental variables for storing credentials used in testing.\nIf you are testing an API endpoint that doesn't require authentication, you\ncan get away without any additional configuration. For the most part, tests\nuse an authenticated client, using a token stored in `ENV['OCTOKIT_TEST_GITHUB_TOKEN']`.\nThere are several different authentication methods used across the api.\nHere is the full list of configurable environmental variables for testing\nOctokit:\n| ENV Variable                                                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| :----------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| `OCTOKIT_TEST_GITHUB_LOGIN`                                  | GitHub login name (preferably one created specifically for testing against).                                                                                                                      |\n| `OCTOKIT_TEST_GITHUB_PASSWORD`                               | Password for the test GitHub login.                                                                                                                                                               |\n| `OCTOKIT_TEST_GITHUB_TOKEN`                                  | [Personal Access Token](https://github.com/blog/1509-personal-api-tokens) for the test GitHub login.                                                                                              |\n| `OCTOKIT_TEST_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`                              | Test OAuth application client id.                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| `OCTOKIT_TEST_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`                          | Test OAuth application client secret.                                                                                                                                                             |\n| `OCTOKIT_TEST_GITHUB_REPOSITORY`                             | Test repository to perform destructive actions against, this should not be set to any repository of importance. **Automatically created by the test suite if nonexistent** Default: `api-sandbox` |\n| `OCTOKIT_TEST_GITHUB_ORGANIZATION`                           | Test organization.                                                                                                                                                                                |\n| `OCTOKIT_TEST_GITHUB_ENTERPRISE_LOGIN`                       | GitHub Enterprise login name.                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| `OCTOKIT_TEST_GITHUB_ENTERPRISE_TOKEN`                       | GitHub Enterprise token.                                                                                                                                                                          |\n| `OCTOKIT_TEST_GITHUB_ENTERPRISE_MANAGEMENT_CONSOLE_PASSWORD` | GitHub Enterprise management console password.                                                                                                                                                    |\n| `OCTOKIT_TEST_GITHUB_ENTERPRISE_ENDPOINT`                    | GitHub Enterprise hostname.                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| `OCTOKIT_TEST_GITHUB_ENTERPRISE_MANAGEMENT_CONSOLE_ENDPOINT` | GitHub Enterprise Management Console endpoint.                                                                                                                                                    |\n| `OCTOKIT_TEST_GITHUB_INTEGRATION`                            | [GitHub Integration](https://developer.github.com/early-access/integrations/) owned by your test organization.                                                                                    |\n| `OCTOKIT_TEST_GITHUB_INTEGRATION_INSTALLATION`               | Installation of the GitHub Integration specified above.                                                                                                                                           |\n| `OCTOKIT_TEST_INTEGRATION_PEM_KEY`                           | File path to the private key generated from your integration.                                                                                                                                     |\nSince we periodically refresh our cassettes, please keep some points in mind\nwhen writing new specs.\n- **Specs should be idempotent**. The HTTP calls made during a spec should be\n  able to be run over and over. This means deleting a known resource prior to\n  creating it if the name has to be unique.\n- **Specs should be able to be run in random order.** If a spec depends on\n  another resource as a fixture, make sure that's created in the scope of the\n  spec and not depend on a previous spec to create the data needed.\n- **Do not depend on authenticated user info.** Instead of asserting\n  actual values in resources, try to assert the existence of a key or that a\n  response is an Array. We're testing the client, not the API.\n[bootstrapping]: http://wynnnetherland.com/linked/2013012801/bootstrapping-consistency\n[vcr]: https://github.com/vcr/vcr\n## Supported Ruby Versions\nThis library aims to support and is [tested against][actions] the following Ruby\nimplementations:\n* Ruby 2.5\n* Ruby 2.6\n* Ruby 2.7\n* Ruby 3.0\n* Ruby 3.1\nIf something doesn't work on one of these Ruby versions, it's a bug.\nThis library may inadvertently work (or seem to work) on other Ruby\nimplementations, but support will only be provided for the versions listed\nabove.\nIf you would like this library to support another Ruby version, you may\nvolunteer to be a maintainer. Being a maintainer entails making sure all tests\nrun and pass on that implementation. When something breaks on your\nimplementation, you will be responsible for providing patches in a timely\nfashion. If critical issues for a particular implementation exist at the time\nof a major release, support for that Ruby version may be dropped.\n[actions]: https://github.com/octokit/octokit.rb/actions\n## Versioning\nThis library aims to adhere to [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0][semver]. Violations\nof this scheme should be reported as bugs. Specifically, if a minor or patch\nversion is released that breaks backward compatibility, that version should be\nimmediately yanked and/or a new version should be immediately released that\nrestores compatibility. Breaking changes to the public API will only be\nintroduced with new major versions. As a result of this policy, you can (and\nshould) specify a dependency on this gem using the [Pessimistic Version\nConstraint][pvc] with two digits of precision. For example:\n    spec.add_dependency 'octokit', '~> 3.0'\nThe changes made between versions can be seen on the [project releases page][releases].\n[semver]: http://semver.org/\n[pvc]: http://guides.rubygems.org/patterns/#pessimistic-version-constraint\n[releases]: https://github.com/octokit/octokit.rb/releases\n## Making Repeating Requests\nIn most cases it would be best to use [webhooks](https://developer.github.com/webhooks/), but sometimes webhooks don't provide all of the information needed. In those cases where one might need to poll for progress or retry a request on failure, we designed [Octopoller](https://github.com/octokit/octopoller.rb). Octopoller is a micro gem perfect for making repeating requests.\n```ruby\nOctopoller.poll(timeout: 15.seconds) do\n  begin\n    client.request_progress # ex. request a long running job's status\n  rescue Error\n    :re_poll\n  end\nend\n```\nThis is useful when making requests for a long running job's progress (ex. requesting a [Source Import's progress](https://developer.github.com/v3/migrations/source_imports/#get-import-progress)).\n## License\nCopyright (c) 2009-2014 Wynn Netherland, Adam Stacoviak, Erik Michaels-Ober\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n\"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND\nNONINFRINGEMENT.

See\n[ACJIRA-1588](https://ecosystem.atlassian.net/browse/ACJIRA-1588) for updates.\n## Installation\nAdd to your `Gemfile`:\n```ruby\ngem 'omniauth-atlassian-oauth2'\n```\nThen `bundle install`.\n## Atlassian API Setup\n* Go to 'https://developer.atlassian.com/apps/'\n* Create a new app.\n* Note the Client ID and Secret values in the App Details section.\n* Under APIs and Features, add the \"Authorization code grants\" feature.\n  Configure the feature with your callback URL (something like\n  http://localhost:3000/auth/atlassian_oauth2/callback).\n* Under APIs and Features, add the \"Jira platform REST API\" API. Configure the\n  API by adding the \"View Jira issue data\" and \"View user profiles\" scopes. These coincide with the scopes listed in the [Jira scopes](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/oauth-2-authorization-code-grants-3lo-for-apps/) section of the Atlassian Docs. Add additional scopes in this UI as needed.\n## Usage\nHere's an example for adding the middleware to a Rails app in\n`config/initializers/omniauth.rb`:\n```ruby\nRails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do\n  provider :atlassian_oauth2, ENV['ATLASSIAN_CLIENT_ID'], ENV['ATLASSIAN_CLIENT_SECRET']\n    scope: \"offline_access read:jira-user read:jira-work\",\n    prompt: \"consent\",\nend\n```\nThis OmniAuth strategy makes API calls that require the `read:jira-user` scope,\nso that scope must be included by you in your OmniAuth configuration. The\n`offline_access` scope must be included if you wish to attain a refresh token.\nYou may wish to include additional scopes depending on how you've configured\nyour app in the Atlassian UI.\nYou can now access the OmniAuth Atlassian OAuth2 URL: `/auth/atlassian_oauth2`\nNOTE: While developing your application, if you change the scope in the\ninitializer you will need to restart your app server. Remember that either the\n'email' or 'profile' scope is required!\n## Auth Hash\nHere's an example of an authentication hash available in the callback by\naccessing `request.env['omniauth.auth']`:\nNote: Atlassian's OAuth2 flow grants access to potentially many Atlassian\n\"sites\", and each site defines a user on its own. There's no single definitive\nprofile of the user. We must loop through the sites and call the\n`/rest/api/3/myself` endpoint for each. `auth_hash['extra']['raw_info']['site']`\nis the site that was used to populate `auth_hash['info']` and\n`auth_hash['uid']`. `auth_hash['extra']['raw_info']['sites']` is the data for\nall the sites available for the user.\nAfter authing a user, when you make API calls over time, you should follow the\n[Atlassian OAuth 2.0 docs](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/oauth-2-authorization-code-grants-3lo-for-apps/)\nand continue to check the `accessible-resources` endpoint to ensure your app\ncontinues to have access to the sites you expect.\n```ruby\n{\n  \"provider\" => \"atlassian_oauth2\",\n  \"uid\" => \"100000000000000000000\",\n  \"info\" => {\n    \"name\" => \"John Smith\",\n    \"email\" => \"john@example.com\",\n    \"nickname\" => \"john_smith\", # username\n    \"location\" => \"Australia/Sydney\", # time zone\n    \"image\" => \"https://whatever.atlassiancdn.com/photo_48x48.jpg\", # 48x48 pixels\n  },\n  \"credentials\" => {\n    \"token\" => \"TOKEN\",\n    \"refresh_token\" => \"REFRESH_TOKEN\",\n    \"expires_at\" => 1496120719,\n    \"expires\" => true\n  },\n  \"extra\" => {\n    \"raw_info\" => {\n      \"site\" => {},\n      \"sites\" => {},\n      \"myself\" => {},\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n## License\nCopyright (c) 2019 by Ben Standefer\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Read the Facebook docs for more details: http://developers.facebook.com/docs/authentication\n## Installing\nAdd to your `Gemfile`:\n```ruby\ngem 'omniauth-facebook'\n```\nThen `bundle install`.\n## Usage\n`OmniAuth::Strategies::Facebook` is simply a Rack middleware. Read the OmniAuth docs for detailed instructions: https://github.com/intridea/omniauth.\nHere's a quick example, adding the middleware to a Rails app in `config/initializers/omniauth.rb`:\n```ruby\nRails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do\n  provider :facebook, ENV['FACEBOOK_KEY'], ENV['FACEBOOK_SECRET']\nend\n```\n[See the example Sinatra app for full examples](https://github.com/mkdynamic/omniauth-facebook/blob/master/example/config.ru) of both the server and client-side flows (including using the Facebook Javascript SDK).\n## Configuring\nYou can configure several options, which you pass in to the `provider` method via a `Hash`:\nOption name | Default | Explanation\n--- | --- | ---\n`scope` | `email` | A comma-separated list of permissions you want to request from the user. See the Facebook docs for a full list of available permissions: https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/login/\n`display` | `page` | The display context to show the authentication page. Options are: `page`, `popup` and `touch`. Read the Facebook docs for more details: https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/dialogs/oauth/\n`image_size` | `square` | Set the size for the returned image url in the auth hash. Valid options include `square` (50x50), `small` (50 pixels wide, variable height), `normal` (100 pixels wide, variable height), or `large` (about 200 pixels wide, variable height). Additionally, you can request a picture of a specific size by setting this option to a hash with `:width` and `:height` as keys. This will return an available profile picture closest to the requested size and requested aspect ratio. If only `:width` or `:height` is specified, we will return a picture whose width or height is closest to the requested size, respectively.\n`info_fields` | 'name,email' | Specify exactly which fields should be returned when getting the user's info. Value should be a comma-separated string as per https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/reference/user/ (only `/me` endpoint).\n`locale` |  | Specify locale which should be used when getting the user's info. Value should be locale string as per https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/api/locale/.\n`auth_type` | | Optionally specifies the requested authentication features as a comma-separated list, as per https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/reauthentication/. Valid values are `https` (checks for the presence of the secure cookie and asks for re-authentication if it is not present), and `reauthenticate` (asks the user to re-authenticate unconditionally). Use 'rerequest' when you want to request premissions. Default is `nil`.\n`secure_image_url` | `false` | Set to `true` to use https for the avatar image url returned in the auth hash.\n`callback_url` / `callback_path` | | Specify a custom callback URL used during the server-side flow. Note this must be allowed by your app configuration on Facebook (see 'Valid OAuth redirect URIs' under the 'Advanced' settings section in the configuration for your Facebook app for more details).\nFor example, to request `email`, `user_birthday` and `read_stream` permissions and display the authentication page in a popup window:\n```ruby\nRails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do\n  provider :facebook, ENV['APP_ID'], ENV['APP_SECRET'],\n    scope: 'email,user_birthday,read_stream', display: 'popup'\nend\n```\n### API Version\nOmniAuth Facebook uses versioned API endpoints by default (current v2.6). You can configure a different version via `client_options` hash passed to `provider`, specifically you should change the version in the `site` and `authorize_url` parameters. For example, to change to v3.0 (assuming that exists):\n```ruby\nuse OmniAuth::Builder do\n  provider :facebook, ENV['APP_ID'], ENV['APP_SECRET'],\n    client_options: {\n      site: 'https://graph.facebook.com/v3.0',\n      authorize_url: \"https://www.facebook.com/v3.0/dialog/oauth\"\n    }\nend\n```\n### Per-Request Options\nIf you want to set the `display` format, `auth_type`, or `scope` on a per-request basis, you can just pass it to the OmniAuth request phase URL, for example: `/auth/facebook?display=popup` or `/auth/facebook?scope=email`.\n## Auth Hash\nHere's an example *Auth Hash* available in `request.env['omniauth.auth']`:\n```ruby\n{\n  provider: 'facebook',\n  uid: '1234567',\n  info: {\n    email: 'joe@bloggs.com',\n    name: 'Joe Bloggs',\n    first_name: 'Joe',\n    last_name: 'Bloggs',\n    image: 'http://graph.facebook.com/1234567/picture?type=square',\n    urls: { Facebook: 'http://www.facebook.com/jbloggs' },\n    location: 'Palo Alto, California',\n    verified: true\n  },\n  credentials: {\n    token: 'ABCDEF...', # OAuth 2.0 access_token, which you may wish to store\n    expires_at: 1321747205, # when the access token expires (it always will)\n    expires: true # this will always be true\n  },\n  extra: {\n    raw_info: {\n      id: '1234567',\n      name: 'Joe Bloggs',\n      first_name: 'Joe',\n      last_name: 'Bloggs',\n      link: 'http://www.facebook.com/jbloggs',\n      username: 'jbloggs',\n      location: { id: '123456789', name: 'Palo Alto, California' },\n      gender: 'male',\n      email: 'joe@bloggs.com',\n      timezone: -8,\n      locale: 'en_US',\n      verified: true,\n      updated_time: '2011-11-11T06:21:03+0000',\n      # ...\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\nThe precise information available may depend on the permissions which you request.\n## Client-side Flow with Facebook Javascript SDK\nYou can use the Facebook Javascript SDK with `FB.login`, and just hit the callback endpoint (`/auth/facebook/callback` by default) once the user has authenticated in the success callback.\n**Note that you must enable cookies in the `FB.init` config for this process to work.**\nSee the example Sinatra app under `example/` and read the [Facebook docs on Login for JavaScript](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/login-flow-for-web/) for more details.\n### How it Works\nThe client-side flow is supported by parsing the authorization code from the signed request which Facebook places in a cookie.\nWhen you call `/auth/facebook/callback` in the success callback of `FB.login` that will pass the cookie back to the server. omniauth-facebook will see this cookie and:\n1. parse it,\n2. extract the authorization code contained in it\n3. and hit Facebook and obtain an access token which will get placed in the `request.env['omniauth.auth']['credentials']` hash.\n## Token Expiry\nThe expiration time of the access token you obtain will depend on which flow you are using.\n### Client-Side Flow\nIf you use the client-side flow, Facebook will give you back a short lived access token (~ 2 hours).\nYou can exchange this short lived access token for a longer lived version. Read the [Facebook docs](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/access-tokens/) for more information on exchanging a short lived token for a long lived token.\n### Server-Side Flow\nIf you use the server-side flow, Facebook will give you back a longer lived access token (~ 60 days).\n## Supported Rubies\n- Ruby MRI (1.9.3+)\n- JRuby (1.9 mode)\n- RBX (2.1.1+)\n## License\nCopyright (c) 2012 by Mark Dodwell\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Remember that either the 'email' or 'profile' scope is required!\n## Configuration\nYou can configure several options, which you pass in to the `provider` method via a hash:\n* `scope`: A comma-separated list of permissions you want to request from the user. See the [Google OAuth 2.0 Playground](https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground/) for a full list of available permissions. Caveats:\n  * The `email` and `profile` scopes are used by default. By defining your own `scope`, you override these defaults, but Google requires at least one of `email` or `profile`, so make sure to add at least one of them to your scope!\n  * Scopes starting with `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/` do not need that prefix specified. So while you can use the smaller scope `books` since that permission starts with the mentioned prefix, you should use the full scope URL `https://docs.google.com/feeds/` to access a user's docs, for example.\n* `redirect_uri`: Override the redirect_uri used by the gem.\n* `prompt`: A space-delimited list of string values that determines whether the user is re-prompted for authentication and/or consent. Possible values are:\n  * `none`: No authentication or consent pages will be displayed; it will return an error if the user is not already authenticated and has not pre-configured consent for the requested scopes. This can be used as a method to check for existing authentication and/or consent.\n  * `consent`: The user will always be prompted for consent, even if they have previously allowed access a given set of scopes.\n  * `select_account`: The user will always be prompted to select a user account. This allows a user who has multiple current account sessions to select one amongst them.\n  If no value is specified, the user only sees the authentication page if they are not logged in and only sees the consent page the first time they authorize a given set of scopes.\n* `image_aspect_ratio`: The shape of the user's profile picture. Possible values are:\n  * `original`: Picture maintains its original aspect ratio.\n  * `square`: Picture presents equal width and height.\n  Defaults to `original`.\n* `image_size`: The size of the user's profile picture. The image returned will have width equal to the given value and variable height, according to the `image_aspect_ratio` chosen. Additionally, a picture with specific width and height can be requested by setting this option to a hash with `width` and `height` as keys. If only `width` or `height` is specified, a picture whose width or height is closest to the requested size and requested aspect ratio will be returned. Defaults to the original width and height of the picture.\n* `name`: The name of the strategy. The default name is `google_oauth2` but it can be changed to any value, for example `google`. The OmniAuth URL will thus change to `/auth/google` and the `provider` key in the auth hash will then return `google`.\n* `access_type`: Defaults to `offline`, so a refresh token is sent to be used when the user is not present at the browser. Can be set to `online`. More about [offline access](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2WebServer#offline)\n* `hd`: (Optional) Limit sign-in to a particular Google Apps hosted domain. This can be simply string `'domain.com'` or an array `%w(domain.com domain.co)`. More information at: https://developers.google.com/accounts/docs/OpenIDConnect#hd-param\n* `jwt_leeway`: Number of seconds passed to the JWT library as leeway. Defaults to 60 seconds. Note this only works if you use jwt 2.1, as the leeway option was removed in later versions.\n* `skip_jwt`: Skip JWT processing. This is for users who are seeing JWT decoding errors with the `iat` field. Always try adjusting the leeway before disabling JWT processing.\n* `login_hint`: When your app knows which user it is trying to authenticate, it can provide this parameter as a hint to the authentication server. Passing this hint suppresses the account chooser and either pre-fill the email box on the sign-in form, or select the proper session (if the user is using multiple sign-in), which can help you avoid problems that occur if your app logs in the wrong user account. The value can be either an email address or the sub string, which is equivalent to the user's Google+ ID.\n* `include_granted_scopes`: If this is provided with the value true, and the authorization request is granted, the authorization will include any previous authorizations granted to this user/application combination for other scopes. See Google's [Incremental Authorization](https://developers.google.com/accounts/docs/OAuth2WebServer#incrementalAuth) for additional details.\n* `openid_realm`: Set the OpenID realm value, to allow upgrading from OpenID based authentication to OAuth 2 based authentication. When this is set correctly an `openid_id` value will be set in `['extra']['id_info']` in the authentication hash with the value of the user's OpenID ID URL.\n* `provider_ignores_state`: You will need to set this to `true` when using the `One-time Code Flow` below. In this flow there is no server side redirect that would set the state.\n* `overridable_authorize_options`: By default, all `authorize_options` can be overridden with request parameters. You can restrict the behavior by using this option.\nHere's an example of a possible configuration where the strategy name is changed, the user is asked for extra permissions, the user is always prompted to select their account when logging in and the user's profile picture is returned as a thumbnail:\n```ruby\nRails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do\n  provider :google_oauth2, ENV['GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID'], ENV['GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET'],\n    {\n      scope: 'email, profile, http://gdata.youtube.com',\n      prompt: 'select_account',\n      image_aspect_ratio: 'square',\n      image_size: 50\n    }\nend\n```\n## Auth Hash\nHere's an example of an authentication hash available in the callback by accessing `request.env['omniauth.auth']`:\n```ruby\n{\n  \"provider\" => \"google_oauth2\",\n  \"uid\" => \"100000000000000000000\",\n  \"info\" => {\n    \"name\" => \"John Smith\",\n    \"email\" => \"john@example.com\",\n    \"first_name\" => \"John\",\n    \"last_name\" => \"Smith\",\n    \"image\" => \"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/photo.jpg\",\n    \"urls\" => {\n      \"google\" => \"https://plus.google.com/+JohnSmith\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"credentials\" => {\n    \"token\" => \"TOKEN\",\n    \"refresh_token\" => \"REFRESH_TOKEN\",\n    \"expires_at\" => 1496120719,\n    \"expires\" => true\n  },\n  \"extra\" => {\n    \"id_token\" => \"ID_TOKEN\",\n    \"id_info\" => {\n      \"azp\" => \"APP_ID\",\n      \"aud\" => \"APP_ID\",\n      \"sub\" => \"100000000000000000000\",\n      \"email\" => \"john@example.com\",\n      \"email_verified\" => true,\n      \"at_hash\" => \"HK6E_P6Dh8Y93mRNtsDB1Q\",\n      \"iss\" => \"accounts.google.com\",\n      \"iat\" => 1496117119,\n      \"exp\" => 1496120719\n    },\n    \"raw_info\" => {\n      \"sub\" => \"100000000000000000000\",\n      \"name\" => \"John Smith\",\n      \"given_name\" => \"John\",\n      \"family_name\" => \"Smith\",\n      \"profile\" => \"https://plus.google.com/+JohnSmith\",\n      \"picture\" => \"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/photo.jpg?sz=50\",\n      \"email\" => \"john@example.com\",\n      \"email_verified\" => \"true\",\n      \"locale\" => \"en\",\n      \"hd\" => \"company.com\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n### Devise\nFirst define your application id and secret in `config/initializers/devise.rb`. Do not use the snippet mentioned in the [Usage](https://github.com/zquestz/omniauth-google-oauth2#usage) section.\nConfiguration options can be passed as the last parameter here as key/value pairs.\n```ruby\nconfig.omniauth :google_oauth2, 'GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID', 'GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET', {}\n```\nNOTE: If you are using this gem with devise with above snippet in `config/initializers/devise.rb` then do not create `config/initializers/omniauth.rb` which will conflict with devise configurations.\nThen add the following to 'config/routes.rb' so the callback routes are defined.\n```ruby\ndevise_for :users, controllers: { omniauth_callbacks: 'users/omniauth_callbacks' }\n```\nMake sure your model is omniauthable. Generally this is \"/app/models/user.rb\"\n```ruby\ndevise :omniauthable, omniauth_providers: [:google_oauth2]\n```\nThen make sure your callbacks controller is setup.\n```ruby\n# app/controllers/users/omniauth_callbacks_controller.rb:\nclass Users::OmniauthCallbacksController < Devise::OmniauthCallbacksController\n  def google_oauth2\n      # You need to implement the method below in your model (e.g. app/models/user.rb)\n      @user = User.from_omniauth(request.env['omniauth.auth'])\n      if @user.persisted?\n        flash[:notice] = I18n.t 'devise.omniauth_callbacks.success', kind: 'Google'\n        sign_in_and_redirect @user, event: :authentication\n      else\n        session['devise.google_data'] = request.env['omniauth.auth'].except('extra') # Removing extra as it can overflow some session stores\n        redirect_to new_user_registration_url, alert: @user.errors.full_messages.join(\"\\n\")\n      end\n  end\nend\n```\nand bind to or create the user\n```ruby\ndef self.from_omniauth(access_token)\n    data = access_token.info\n    user = User.where(email: data['email']).first\n    # Uncomment the section below if you want users to be created if they don't exist\n    # unless user\n    #     user = User.create(name: data['name'],\n    #        email: data['email'],\n    #        password: Devise.friendly_token[0,20]\n    #     )\n    # end\n    user\nend\n```\nFor your views you can login using:\n```erb\n<%# omniauth-google-oauth2 1.0.x uses OmniAuth 2 and requires using HTTP Post to initiate authentication: %>\n<%= link_to \"Sign in with Google\", user_google_oauth2_omniauth_authorize_path, method: :post %>\n<%# omniauth-google-oauth2 prior 1.0.0: %>\n<%= link_to \"Sign in with Google\", user_google_oauth2_omniauth_authorize_path %>\n<%# Devise prior 4.1.0: %>\n<%= link_to \"Sign in with Google\", user_omniauth_authorize_path(:google_oauth2) %>\n```\nAn overview is available at https://github.com/plataformatec/devise/wiki/OmniAuth:-Overview\n### One-time Code Flow (Hybrid Authentication)\nGoogle describes the One-time Code Flow [here](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web/server-side-flow).  This hybrid authentication flow has significant functional and security advantages over a pure server-side or pure client-side flow.  The following steps occur in this flow:\n1. The client (web browser) authenticates the user directly via Google's JS API.  During this process assorted modals may be rendered by Google.\n2. On successful authentication, Google returns a one-time use code, which requires the Google client secret (which is only available server-side).\n3. Using a AJAX request, the code is POSTed to the Omniauth Google OAuth2 callback.\n4. The Omniauth Google OAuth2 gem will validate the code via a server-side request to Google.  If the code is valid, then Google will return an access token and, if this is the first time this user is authenticating against this application, a refresh token.  Both of these should be stored on the server.  The response to the AJAX request indicates the success or failure of this process.\nThis flow is immune to replay attacks, and conveys no useful information to a man in the middle.\nThe omniauth-google-oauth2 gem supports this mode of operation when `provider_ignores_state` is set to `true`.  Implementors simply need to add the appropriate JavaScript to their web page, and they can take advantage of this flow.  An example JavaScript snippet follows.\n```javascript\n// Basic hybrid auth example following the pattern at:\n// https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web/reference\n<script src=\"https://apis.google.com/js/platform.js?onload=init\" async defer></script>\n...\nfunction init() {\n  gapi.load('auth2', function() {\n    // Ready.\n    $('.google-login-button').click(function(e) {\n      e.preventDefault();\n      gapi.auth2.authorize({\n        client_id: 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID',\n        cookie_policy: 'single_host_origin',\n        scope: 'email profile',\n        response_type: 'code'\n      }, function(response) {\n        if (response && !response.error) {\n          // google authentication succeed, now post data to server.\n          jQuery.ajax({type: 'POST', url: '/auth/google_oauth2/callback', data: response,\n            success: function(data) {\n              // response from server\n            }\n          });\n        } else {\n          // google authentication failed\n        }\n      });\n    });\n  });\n};\n```\n#### Note about mobile clients (iOS, Android)\nThe documentation at https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/ios/offline-access specifies the _REDIRECT_URI_ to be either a set value or an EMPTY string for mobile logins to work. Else, you will run into _redirect_uri_mismatch_ errors.\nIn that case, ensure to send an additional parameter `redirect_uri=` (empty string) to the `/auth/google_oauth2/callback` URL from your mobile device.\n#### Note about CORS\nIf you're making POST requests to `/auth/google_oauth2/callback` from another domain, then you need to make sure `'X-Requested-With': 'XMLHttpRequest'` header is included with your request, otherwise your server might respond with `OAuth2::Error, : Invalid Value` error.\n#### Getting around the `redirect_uri_mismatch` error (See [Issue #365](https://github.com/zquestz/omniauth-google-oauth2/issues/365))\nIf you are struggling with a persistent `redirect_uri_mismatch`, you can instead pass the `access_token` from [`getAuthResponse`](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web/reference#googleusergetauthresponseincludeauthorizationdata) directly to the `auth/google_oauth2/callback` endpoint, like so:\n```javascript\n// Initialize the GoogleAuth object\nlet googleAuth;\ngapi.load('client:auth2', async () => {\n  await gapi.client.init({ scope: '...', client_id: '...' });\n  googleAuth = gapi.auth2.getAuthInstance();\n});\n// Call this when the Google Sign In button is clicked\nasync function signInGoogle() {\n  const googleUser = await googleAuth.signIn(); // wait for the user to authorize through the modal\n  const { access_token } = googleUser.getAuthResponse();\n  const data = new FormData();\n  data.append('access_token', access_token);\n  const response = await api.post('/auth/google_oauth2/callback', data)\n  console.log(response);\n}\n```\n#### Using Axios\nIf you're making a GET resquests from another domain using `access_token`.\n```\naxios\n  .get(\n    'url(path to your callback}',\n    { params: { access_token: 'token' } },\n    headers....\n    )\n```\nIf you're making a POST resquests from another domain using `access_token`.\n```\naxios\n  .post(\n    'url(path to your callback}',\n    { access_token: 'token' },\n    headers....\n    )\n--OR--\naxios\n  .post(\n    'url(path to your callback}',\n    null,\n      {\n        params: {\n          access_token: 'token'\n        },\n        headers....\n      }\n    )\n```\n## Fixing Protocol Mismatch for `redirect_uri` in Rails\nJust set the `full_host` in OmniAuth based on the Rails.env.\n```\n# config/initializers/omniauth.rb\nOmniAuth.config.full_host = Rails.env.production? ? 'https://domain.com' : 'http://localhost:3000'\n```\n## License\nCopyright (c) 2018 by Josh Ellithorpe\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

If you do not know OmniAuth, please visit OmniAuth wiki.\nhttps://github.com/intridea/omniauth/wiki\nThe detail of the authentication middleware Shibboleth is introduced in Shibboleth wiki.\nhttps://wiki.shibboleth.net/\nOmniAuth basically works as a middleware of Rack applications. It provides environment variable named 'omniauth.auth' (auth hash) after authenticating a user. The 'auth hash' includes the user's attributes. By providing user attributes in the fixed format, applications can easily implement authentication function using multiple authentication methods.\nOmniAuth Shibboleth strategy uses the 'auth hash' for providing user attributes passed by Shibboleth SP. It enables developers to use Shibboleth and the other authentication methods, including local auth, together in one application.\nCurrently, this document is written for Rails applications. If you tried the other environments and it requires some difficulities, please let me know in the Issues page.\nhttps://github.com/toyokazu/omniauth-shibboleth/issues\n## Getting Started\n### Setup Gemfile and Install\n    % cd rails-app\n    % vi Gemfile\n    gem 'omniauth-shibboleth'\n    % bundle install\n### Setup Shibboleth Strategy\nTo use OmniAuth Shibboleth strategy as a middleware in your rails application, add the following file to your rails application initializer directory.\n    % vi config/initializer/omniauth.rb\n    Rails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do\n      provider :shibboleth\n    end\n    % vi config/initializer/omniauth.rb\n    Rails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do\n      provider :shibboleth, {\n        :shib_session_id_field     => \"Shib-Session-ID\",\n        :shib_application_id_field => \"Shib-Application-ID\",\n        :debug                     => false,\n        :extra_fields => [\n          :\"unscoped-affiliation\",\n          :entitlement\n        ]\n      }\n    end\nIn the above example, 'unscoped-affiliation' and 'entitlement' attributes are additionally provided in the raw_info field. They can be referred like request.env[\"omniauth.auth\"][\"extra\"][\"raw_info\"][\"unscoped-affiliation\"]. The detail of the omniauth auth hash schema is described in the following page.\nhttps://github.com/intridea/omniauth/wiki/Auth-Hash-Schema\n'eppn' attribute is used as uid field. 'displayName' attribute is provided as request.env[\"omniauth.auth\"][\"info\"][\"name\"].\nThese can be changed by :uid_field, :name_field option. You can also add any \"info\" fields defined in Auth-Hash-Schema by using :info_fields option.\n    % vi config/initializer/omniauth.rb\n    Rails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do\n      provider :shibboleth, {\n        :uid_field                 => \"uid\",\n        :name_field                => \"displayName\",\n        :info_fields => {\n          :email    => \"mail\",\n          :location => \"contactAddress\",\n          :image    => \"photo_url\",\n          :phone    => \"contactPhone\"\n        }\n      }\n    end\nIn the previous example, Shibboleth strategy does not pass any :info fields and use 'uid' attribute as uid fields.\n### More flexible attribute configuration\nIf you need more flexible attribute definition, you can use lambda (Proc) to define your attributes. In the following example, 'uid' attribute is chosen from 'eppn' or 'mail', 'info'/'name' attribute is defined as a concatenation of 'cn' and 'sn' and 'info'/'affiliation' attribute is defined as 'affiliation'@my.localdomain. 'request_param' parameter is a method defined in OmniAuth::Shibboleth::Strategy. You can specify attribute names by downcase strings in either request_type, :env, :header and :params.\n    % vi config/initializer/omniauth.rb\n    Rails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do\n      provider :shibboleth, {\n        :uid_field                 => lambda {|request_param| request_param.call('eppn') || request_param.call('mail')},\n        :name_field                => lambda {|request_param| \"#{request_param.call('cn')} #{request_param.call('sn')}\"},\n        :info_fields => {\n          :affiliation => lambda {|request_param| \"#{request_param.call('affiliation')}@my.localdomain\"},\n          :email    => \"mail\",\n          :location => \"contactAddress\",\n          :image    => \"photo_url\",\n          :phone    => \"contactPhone\"\n        }\n      }\n    end\n### !!!NOTICE!!! devise integration issue\nWhen you use omniauth with devise, the omniauth configuration is applied before devise configuration and some part of the configuration overwritten by the devise's. It may not work as you assume. So thus, in that case, currently you should write your configuration only in device configuration.\nconfig/initializers/devise.rb:\n```ruby\nconfig.omniauth :shibboleth, {:uid_field => 'eppn',\n                         :info_fields => {:email => 'mail', :name => 'cn', :last_name => 'sn'},\n                         :extra_fields => [:schacHomeOrganization]\n                  }\n```\nThe detail is discussed in the following thread.\nhttps://github.com/plataformatec/devise/issues/2128\n### How to authenticate users\nIn your application, simply direct users to '/auth/shibboleth' to have them sign in via your company's Shibboleth SP and IdP. '/auth/shibboleth' url simply redirect users to '/auth/shibboleth/callback', so thus you must protect '/auth/shibboleth/callback' by Shibboleth SP.\nExample shibd.conf:\n    <Location /application_path/auth/shibboleth/callback>\n      AuthType shibboleth\n      ShibRequestSetting requireSession 1\n      require valid-user\n    </Location>\nShibboleth strategy just checks the existence of Shib-Session-ID or Shib-Application-ID.\nIf you want to use omniauth-shibboleth without Apache or IIS, you can try **rack-saml**. It supports a part of Shibboleth SP functions.\nhttps://github.com/toyokazu/rack-saml\nShibboleth strategy assumes the attributes are provided via environment variables because the use of ShibUseHeaders option may cause some problems. The details are discussed in the following page:\nhttps://wiki.shibboleth.net/confluence/display/SHIB2/NativeSPSpoofChecking\nTo provide Shibboleth attributes via environment variables, we can not use proxy based approach, e.g. mod_proxy_balancer. Currently we can realize it by using Phusion Passenger as an application container. An example construction pattern is shown in presence_checker application (https://github.com/toyokazu/presence_checker/).\n### :request_type option\nYou understand the issues using ShibUseHeaders, but and yet if you want to use the proxy based approach, you can use :request_type option. This option enables us to specify what kind of parameters are used to create 'omniauth.auth' (auth hash). This option can also be used to develop your Rails application without local IdP and SP by using :params option. The option values are:\n- **:env** (default) The environment variables are used to create auth hash.\n- **:header** The auth hash is created from header vaiables. In the Rack middleware, since header variables are treated as environment variables like HTTP_*, the specified variables are converted as the same as header variables, HTTP_*. This :request_type is basically used for mod_proxy_balancer approach.\n- **:params** The query string or POST parameters are used to create auth hash. This :request_type is basically used for development phase. You can emulate SP function by providing parameters as query string. In this case, please do not forget to add Shib-Session-ID or Shib-Application-ID value which is used to check the session is created at SP.\nThe following is an example configuration.\n    % vi config/initializer/omniauth.rb\n    Rails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do\n      provider :shibboleth, { :request_type => :header }\n    end\nIf you use proxy based approach, please be sure to add ShibUseHeaders option in mod_shib configuration.\n    <Location /secure>\n      AuthType shibboleth\n      ShibRequestSetting requireSession 1\n      ShibUseHeaders On\n      require valid-user\n    </Location>\n### debug mode\nWhen you deploy a new application, you may want to confirm the assumed attributes are correctly provided by Shibboleth SP. OmniAuth Shibboleth strategy provides a confirmation option :debug. If you set :debug true, you can see the environment variables provided at the /auth/shibboleth/callback uri.\n    % vi config/initializer/omniauth.rb\n    Rails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do\n      provider :shibboleth, { :debug => true }\n    end\n### :multi_values option\nIf your application want to receive multiple values as one attribute, Shibboleth passes them as follows:\n    user2@example2.com;user1@example1.com;user3@example3.com\nIf your application only wants the first entry sorted by alphabetical order, you can use flexible attribute configuration as follows (since semicolons in attribute values are escaped with a backslash, escaped semicolons are skiped for splitting):\n    % vi config/initializer/omniauth.rb\n    Rails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do\n      provider :shibboleth, {\n        :info_fields => {\n          :email    => lambda {|request_param| request_param.call('email').split(/(?<!\\\\);/).sort[0]}\n        }\n      }\n    end\nHowever, if you use device to integrate omniauth, lambda function cannot be used. In such a situation, if you still think that attribute conversions in the middleware is required, you can use :multi_values option.\n- **:raw** (default) Raw multiple values are passed to the application.\n- **:first** The first entry of multiple values is passed to the application.\n- **lambda function** The other descriptions are regarded as lambda function written in String form. The string will be evaluated as Ruby code and used for processing multiple values in the attribute.\nIf you specify :first, you can obtain `user2@example.com` in the above example.\n    % vi config/initializer/omniauth.rb\n    Rails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do\n      provider :shibboleth, {\n        :multi_values => :first\n      }\n    end\nIf you need the first attribute in alphabetical order, you can specify lambda function in String form as follows:\n    % vi config/initializer/omniauth.rb\n    Rails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do\n      provider :shibboleth, {\n        :multi_values => 'lambda {|param_value| param_value.nil? ? nil : param_value.split(/(?<!\\\\\\\\);/).sort[0]}'\n      }\n    end\n## License (MIT License)\nomniauth-shibboleth is released under the MIT license.\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

This strategy implements the browser variant of the \"[Sign in with Twitter](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/auth/implementing-sign-twitter)\" flow.\nTwitter uses OAuth 1.0a. Twitter's developer area contains ample documentation on how it implements this, so check that out if you are really interested in the details.\n## Before You Begin\nYou should have already installed OmniAuth into your app; if not, read the [OmniAuth README](https://github.com/intridea/omniauth) to get started.\nNow sign in into the [Twitter developer area](https://dev.twitter.com/apps) and create an application. Take note of your API Key and API Secret (not the Access Token and Access Token Secret) because that is what your web application will use to authenticate against the Twitter API. Make sure to set a callback URL or else you may get authentication errors. (It doesn't matter what it is, just that it is set.)\n## Using This Strategy\nFirst start by adding this gem to your Gemfile:\n```ruby\ngem 'omniauth-twitter'\n```\nIf you need to use the latest HEAD version, you can do so with:\n```ruby\ngem 'omniauth-twitter', :github => 'arunagw/omniauth-twitter'\n```\nNext, tell OmniAuth about this provider. For a Rails app, your `config/initializers/omniauth.rb` file should look like this:\n```ruby\nRails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do\n  provider :twitter, \"API_KEY\", \"API_SECRET\"\nend\n```\nReplace `\"API_KEY\"` and `\"API_SECRET\"` with the appropriate values you obtained [earlier](https://apps.twitter.com).\n## Authentication Options\nTwitter supports a [few options](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1/get/oauth/authenticate) when authenticating. Usually you would specify these options as query parameters to the Twitter API authentication url (`https://api.twitter.com/oauth/authenticate` by default). With OmniAuth, of course, you use `http://yourapp.com/auth/twitter` instead. Because of this, this OmniAuth provider will pick up the query parameters you pass to the `/auth/twitter` URL and re-use them when making the call to the Twitter API.\nThe options are:\n* **force_login** - This option sends the user to a sign-in screen to enter their Twitter credentials, even if they are already signed in. This is handy when your application supports multiple Twitter accounts and you want to ensure the correct user is signed in. *Example:* `http://yoursite.com/auth/twitter?force_login=true`\n* **screen_name** - This option implies **force_login**, except the screen name field is pre-filled with a particular value. *Example:* `http://yoursite.com/auth/twitter?screen_name=jim`\n* **lang** - The language used in the Twitter prompt. This is useful for adding i18n support since the language of the prompt can be dynamically set for each user. *Example:* `http://yoursite.com/auth/twitter?lang=pt`\n* **secure_image_url** - Set to `true` to use https for the user's image url. Default is `false`.\n* **image_size**: This option defines the size of the user's image. Valid options include `mini` (24x24), `normal` (48x48), `bigger` (73x73) and `original` (the size of the image originally uploaded). Default is `normal`.\n* **x_auth_access_type** - This option (described [here](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1/post/oauth/request_token)) lets you request the level of access that your app will have to the Twitter account in question. *Example:* `http://yoursite.com/auth/twitter?x_auth_access_type=read`\n* **use_authorize** - There are actually two URLs you can use against the Twitter API. As mentioned, the default is `https://api.twitter.com/oauth/authenticate`, but you also have `https://api.twitter.com/oauth/authorize`. Passing this option as `true` will use the second URL rather than the first. What's the difference? As described [here](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1/get/oauth/authenticate), with `authenticate`, if your user has already granted permission to your application, Twitter will redirect straight back to your application, whereas `authorize` forces the user to go through the \"grant permission\" screen again. For certain use cases this may be necessary. *Example:* `http://yoursite.com/auth/twitter?use_authorize=true`. *Note:* You must have \"Allow this application to be used to Sign in with Twitter\" checked in [your application's settings](https://dev.twitter.com/apps) - without it your user will be asked to authorize your application each time they log in.\nHere's an example of a possible configuration where the the user's original profile picture is returned over https, the user is always prompted to sign-in and the default language of the Twitter prompt is changed:\n```ruby\nRails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do\n  provider :twitter, \"API_KEY\", \"API_SECRET\",\n    {\n      :secure_image_url => 'true',\n      :image_size => 'original',\n      :authorize_params => {\n        :force_login => 'true',\n        :lang => 'pt'\n      }\n    }\nend\n```\n## Authentication Hash\nAn example auth hash available in `request.env['omniauth.auth']`:\n```ruby\n{\n  :provider => \"twitter\",\n  :uid => \"123456\",\n  :info => {\n    :nickname => \"johnqpublic\",\n    :name => \"John Q Public\",\n    :location => \"Anytown, USA\",\n    :image => \"http://si0.twimg.com/sticky/default_profile_images/default_profile_2_normal.png\",\n    :description => \"a very normal guy.\",\n    :urls => {\n      :Website => nil,\n      :Twitter => \"https://twitter.com/johnqpublic\"\n    }\n  },\n  :credentials => {\n    :token => \"a1b2c3d4...\", # The OAuth 2.0 access token\n    :secret => \"abcdef1234\"\n  },\n  :extra => {\n    :access_token => \"\", # An OAuth::AccessToken object\n    :raw_info => {\n      :name => \"John Q Public\",\n      :listed_count => 0,\n      :profile_sidebar_border_color => \"181A1E\",\n      :url => nil,\n      :lang => \"en\",\n      :statuses_count => 129,\n      :profile_image_url => \"http://si0.twimg.com/sticky/default_profile_images/default_profile_2_normal.png\",\n      :profile_background_image_url_https => \"https://twimg0-a.akamaihd.net/profile_background_images/229171796/pattern_036.gif\",\n      :location => \"Anytown, USA\",\n      :time_zone => \"Chicago\",\n      :follow_request_sent => false,\n      :id => 123456,\n      :profile_background_tile => true,\n      :profile_sidebar_fill_color => \"666666\",\n      :followers_count => 1,\n      :default_profile_image => false,\n      :screen_name => \"\",\n      :following => false,\n      :utc_offset => -3600,\n      :verified => false,\n      :favourites_count => 0,\n      :profile_background_color => \"1A1B1F\",\n      :is_translator => false,\n      :friends_count => 1,\n      :notifications => false,\n      :geo_enabled => true,\n      :profile_background_image_url => \"http://twimg0-a.akamaihd.net/profile_background_images/229171796/pattern_036.gif\",\n      :protected => false,\n      :description => \"a very normal guy.\",\n      :profile_link_color => \"2FC2EF\",\n      :created_at => \"Thu Jul 4 00:00:00 +0000 2013\",\n      :id_str => \"123456\",\n      :profile_image_url_https => \"https://si0.twimg.com/sticky/default_profile_images/default_profile_2_normal.png\",\n      :default_profile => false,\n      :profile_use_background_image => false,\n      :entities => {\n        :description => {\n          :urls => []\n        }\n      },\n      :profile_text_color => \"666666\",\n      :contributors_enabled => false\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n## Watch the RailsCast\nRyan Bates has put together an excellent RailsCast on OmniAuth:\n[![RailsCast #241](http://railscasts.com/static/episodes/stills/241-simple-omniauth-revised.png \"RailsCast #241 - Simple OmniAuth (revised)\")](http://railscasts.com/episodes/241-simple-omniauth-revised)\n## Supported Rubies\nOmniAuth Twitter is tested under 2.1.x, 2.2.x and JRuby.\nIf you use its gem on ruby 1.9.x, 2.0.x, or Rubinius use version v1.2.1 .\n## Contributing\nPlease read the [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for some information on how to get started.

This new option solves\nthe [PATHEXT](https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/2318) issue but:\n- It's not supported in node `<v4.8`\n- You must manually escape the command and arguments which is very error prone, specially when passing user input\n- There are a lot of other unresolved issues from the [Why](#why) section that you must take into account\nIf you are using the `shell` option to spawn a command in a cross platform way, consider using `cross-spawn` instead. You have been warned.\n### `options.shell` support\nWhile `cross-spawn` adds support for `options.shell` in node `<v4.8`, all of its enhancements are disabled.\nThis mimics the Node.js behavior. More specifically, the command and its arguments will not be automatically escaped nor shebang support will be offered. This is by design because if you are using `options.shell` you are probably targeting a specific platform anyway and you don't want things to get into your way.\n### Shebangs support\nWhile `cross-spawn` handles shebangs on Windows, its support is limited. More specifically, it just supports `#!/usr/bin/env <program>` where `<program>` must not contain any arguments.   \nIf you would like to have the shebang support improved, feel free to contribute via a pull-request.\nRemember to always test your code on Windows!\n## Tests\n`$ npm test`   \n`$ npm test -- --watch` during development\n## License\nReleased under the [MIT License](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php).\nThe MIT License (MIT)\nCopyright (c) 2018 Made With MOXY Lda <hello@moxy.studio>\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Most clients,\nespecially web clients, ignore linked stylesheets or `<style>` tags in the HTML.\nThe workaround is to write all the CSS rules in the `style` attribute of each\ntag inside your email. This is a rather tedious and hard to maintain approach.\nPremailer to the rescue! The great [premailer] gem applies all CSS rules to each\nmatching HTML element by adding them to the `style` attribute. This allows you\nto keep HTML and CSS in separate files, just as you're used to from web\ndevelopment, thus keeping your sanity.\nThis gem is an adapter for premailer to work with [actionmailer] out of the box.\nActionmailer is the email framework used in Rails, which also works outside of\nRails. Although premailer-rails has certain Rails specific features, **it also\nworks in the absence of Rails** making it compatible with other frameworks such\nas sinatra.\n## How It Works\npremailer-rails works with actionmailer by registering a delivery hook. This\ncauses all emails that are delivered to be processed by premailer-rails. This\nmeans that by simply including premailer-rails in your `Gemfile` you'll get\nstyled emails without having to set anything up.\nWhenever premailer-rails processes an email, it collects the URLs of all linked\nstylesheets (`<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"css_url\">`). Then, for each of these\nURLs, it tries to get the content through a couple of strategies. As long as\na strategy does not return anything, the next one is used. The strategies\navailable are:\n-   `:filesystem`: If there's a file inside `public/` with the same path as in\n    the URL, it is read from disk. E.g. if the URL is\n    `http://cdn.example.com/assets/email.css` the contents of the file located\n    at `public/assets/email.css` gets returned if it exists.\n-   `:asset_pipeline`: If Rails is available and the asset pipeline is enabled,\n    the file is retrieved through the asset pipeline. E.g. if the URL is\n    `http://cdn.example.com/assets/email-fingerprint123.css`, the file\n    `email.css` is requested from the asset pipeline. That is, the fingerprint\n    and the prefix (in this case `assets` is the prefix) are stripped before\n    requesting it from the asset pipeline.\n-   `:network`: As a last resort, the URL is simply requested and the response\n    body is used. This is useful when the assets are not bundled in the\n    application and only available on a CDN. On Heroku e.g. you can add assets\n    to your `.slugignore` causing your assets to not be available to the app\n    (and thus resulting in a smaller app) and deploy the assets to a CDN such\n    as S3/CloudFront.\nYou can configure which strategies you want to use as well as specify their\norder. Refer to the *Configuration* section for more on this.\nNote that the retrieved CSS is cached when the gem is running with Rails in\nproduction.\n## Installation\nSimply add the gem to your `Gemfile`:\n```ruby\ngem 'premailer-rails'\n```\npremailer-rails and premailer require a gem that is used to parse the email's\nHTML. For a list of supported gems and how to select which one to use, please\nrefer to the [*Adapter*\nsection](https://github.com/premailer/premailer#adapters) of premailer. Note\nthat there is no hard dependency from either gem so you should add one yourself.\nAlso note that this gem is only tested with [nokogiri].\n## Configuration\nPremailer itself accepts a number of options. In order for premailer-rails to\npass these options on to the underlying premailer instance, specify them\nas follows (in Rails you could do that in an initializer such as\n`config/initializers/premailer_rails.rb`):\n```ruby\nPremailer::Rails.config.merge!(preserve_styles: true, remove_ids: true)\n```\nFor a list of options, refer to the [premailer documentation]. The default\nconfigs are:\n```ruby\n{\n  input_encoding: 'UTF-8',\n  generate_text_part: true,\n  strategies: [:filesystem, :asset_pipeline, :network]\n}\n```\nIf you don't want to automatically generate a text part from the html part, set\nthe config `:generate_text_part` to false.\nNote that the options `:with_html_string` and `:css_string` are used internally\nby premailer-rails and thus will be overridden.\nIf you're using this gem outside of Rails, you'll need to call\n`Premailer::Rails.register_interceptors` manually in order for it to work. This\nis done ideally in some kind of initializer, depending on the framework you're\nusing.\npremailer-rails reads all stylesheet `<link>` tags, inlines the linked CSS\nand removes the tags. If you wish to ignore a certain tag, e.g. one that links to\nexternal fonts such as Google Fonts, you can add a `data-premailer=\"ignore\"`\nattribute.\n## Usage\npremailer-rails processes all outgoing emails by default. If you wish to skip\npremailer for a certain email, simply set the `:skip_premailer` header:\n```ruby\nclass UserMailer < ActionMailer::Base\n  def welcome_email(user)\n    mail to: user.email,\n         subject: 'Welcome to My Awesome Site',\n         skip_premailer: true\n  end\nend\n```\nNote that the mere presence of this header causes premailer to be skipped, i.e.,\neven setting `skip_premailer: false` will cause premailer to be skipped. The\nreason for that is that the `skip_premailer` is a simple header and the value is\ntransformed into a string, causing `'false'` to become truthy.\nEmails are only processed upon delivery, i.e. when calling `#deliver` on the\nemail, or when [previewing them in\nrails](http://api.rubyonrails.org/v4.1.0/classes/ActionMailer/Base.html#class-ActionMailer::Base-label-Previewing+emails).\nIf you wish to manually trigger the inlining, you can do so by calling the hook:\n```ruby\nmail = SomeMailer.some_message(args)\nPremailer::Rails::Hook.perform(mail)\n```\nThis will modify the email in place, useful e.g. in tests.\n## Small Print\n### Author\nPhilipe Fatio ([@fphilipe][fphilipe twitter])\n### License\npremailer-rails is released under the MIT license.

Simply insert the `Rack::Accept` module in your Rack\nmiddleware pipeline and access the `Rack::Accept::Request` object in the\n`rack-accept.request` environment key, as in the following example.\n```ruby\nrequire 'rack/accept'\nuse Rack::Accept\napp = lambda do |env|\n  accept = env['rack-accept.request']\n  response = Rack::Response.new\n  if accept.media_type?('text/html')\n    response['Content-Type'] = 'text/html'\n    response.write \"<p>Hello. You accept text/html!</p>\"\n  else\n    response['Content-Type'] = 'text/plain'\n    response.write \"Apparently you don't accept text/html. Too bad.\"\n  end\n  response.finish\nend\nrun app\n```\n**Rack::Accept** can also construct automatic [406][406] responses if you set up\nthe types of media, character sets, encoding, or languages your server is able\nto serve ahead of time. If you pass a configuration block to your `use`\nstatement it will yield the `Rack::Accept::Context` object that is used for that\ninvocation.\n[406]: http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html#sec10.4.7\n```ruby\nrequire 'rack/accept'\nuse(Rack::Accept) do |context|\n  # We only ever serve content in English or Japanese from this site, so if\n  # the user doesn't accept either of these we will respond with a 406.\n  context.languages = %w< en jp >\nend\napp = ...\nrun app\n```\n**Note:** _You should think carefully before using Rack::Accept in this way.\nMany user agents are careless about the types of Accept headers they send, and\ndepend on apps not being too picky. Instead of automatically sending a 406, you\nshould probably only send one when absolutely necessary._\nAdditionally, **Rack::Accept** may be used outside of a Rack context to provide\nany Ruby app the ability to construct and interpret Accept headers.\n```ruby\nrequire 'rack/accept'\nmtype = Rack::Accept::MediaType.new\nmtype.qvalues = { 'text/html' => 1, 'text/*' => 0.8, '*/*' => 0.5 }\nmtype.to_s # => \"Accept: text/html, text/*;q=0.8, */*;q=0.5\"\ncset = Rack::Accept::Charset.new('unicode-1-1, iso-8859-5;q=0.8')\ncset.best_of(%w< iso-8859-5 unicode-1-1 >)  # => \"unicode-1-1\"\ncset.accept?('iso-8859-1')                  # => true\n```\nThe very last line in this example may look like a mistake to someone not\nfamiliar with the intricacies of [the spec][rfc-sec14-3], but it's actually\ncorrect. It just puts emphasis on the convenience of using this library so you\ndon't have to worry about these kinds of details.\n## Four-letter Words\n  - Spec: [http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html][rfc-sec14]\n  - Code: [http://github.com/mjijackson/rack-accept][code]\n  - Bugs: [http://github.com/mjijackson/rack-accept/issues][bugs]\n  - Docs: [http://mjijackson.github.com/rack-accept][docs]\n[code]: http://github.com/mjijackson/rack-accept\n[bugs]: http://github.com/mjijackson/rack-accept/issues\n[docs]: http://mjijackson.github.com/rack-accept\n## License\nCopyright 2012 Michael Jackson\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\nThe software is provided \"as is\", without warranty of any kind, express or\nimplied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability,\nfitness for a particular purpose and noninfringement.

The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n   5.

Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n   7.

Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

URLs without a protocol\nspecifier but starting with 'www.' will also be autolinked, defaulting to\nthe 'http://' protocol.\n-   `text` is a string in plain text or HTML markup. If the string is formatted in\nHTML, Rinku is smart enough to skip the links that are already enclosed in `<a>`\ntags.`\n-   `mode` is a symbol, either `:all`, `:urls` or `:email_addresses`, \nwhich specifies which kind of links will be auto-linked. \n-   `link_attr` is a string containing the link attributes for each link that\nwill be generated. These attributes are not sanitized and will be include as-is\nin each generated link, e.g.\n     ~~~~~ruby\n     auto_link('http://www.pokemon.com', :all, 'target=\"_blank\"')\n     # => '<a href=\"http://www.pokemon.com\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.pokemon.com</a>'\n     ~~~~~\n    This string can be autogenerated from a hash using the Rails `tag_options` helper.\n-   `skip_tags` is a list of strings with the names of HTML tags that will be skipped\nwhen autolinking. If `nil`, this defaults to the value of the global `Rinku.skip_tags`,\nwhich is initially `[\"a\", \"pre\", \"code\", \"kbd\", \"script\"]`.\n-   `&block` is an optional block argument. If a block is passed, it will\nbe yielded for each found link in the text, and its return value will be used instead\nof the name of the link. E.g.\n    ~~~~~ruby\n    auto_link('Check it out at http://www.pokemon.com') do |url|\n      \"THE POKEMAN WEBSITEZ\"\n    end\n    # => 'Check it out at <a href=\"http://www.pokemon.com\">THE POKEMAN WEBSITEZ</a>'\n    ~~~~~~\nRinku is a drop-in replacement for Rails 3.1 `auto_link`\n----------------------------------------------------\nAuto-linking functionality has been removed from Rails 3.1,\nand is instead offered as a standalone gem, `rails_autolink`. You can\nchoose to use Rinku instead.\n~~~~ruby\nrequire 'rails_rinku'\n~~~~\nThe `rails_rinku` package monkeypatches Rails with an `auto_link` method that\nmimics 100% the original one, parameter per parameter. It's just faster.\nDeveloping\n----------\n```\n$ gem install rake-compiler\n$ rake\n```\nRinku is written by me\n----------------------\nI am Vicent Marti, and I wrote Rinku.\nWhile Rinku is busy doing autolinks, you should be busy following me on twitter.\n[`@vmg`](http://twitter.com/vmg).

Previous png rendering could result in hard to scan qrcodes.\n  *Big thanks to Bart Jedrocha*\n*0.5.5* (Apr 25, 2015)\n- Fixed major bug. The rs block data was missing resulting in qr codes failing to be generated.\n  *Upgrade highly recomended!!*\n## Overview\nrQRCode is a library for encoding QR Codes in Ruby. It has a simple interface with all the standard qrcode options. It was adapted from the Javascript library by Kazuhiko Arase.\nLet's clear up some rQRCode stuff.\n* rQRCode is a __standalone library__ It requires no other libraries. Just Ruby!\n* It is an encoding library. You can't decode QR codes with it.\n* The interface is simple and assumes you just want to encode a string into a QR code\n* QR code is trademarked by Denso Wave inc\n## Installing\nYou may get the latest stable version from Rubygems.\n```ruby\ngem install rqrcode\n```\n## Using rQRCode\n```ruby\nrequire 'rqrcode'\nqrcode = RQRCode::QRCode.new(\"http://github.com/\")\nimage = qrcode.as_png\nsvg = qrcode.as_svg\nhtml = qrcode.as_html\nstring = qrcode.to_s\n```\n## Image Rendering\n### SVG\nThe SVG renderer will produce a stand-alone SVG as a `String`\n```ruby\nqrcode = RQRCode::QRCode.new(\"http://github.com/\")\n# With default options specified explicitly\nsvg = qrcode.as_svg(offset: 0, color: '000', \n                    shape_rendering: 'crispEdges', \n                    module_size: 11)\n```\n### PNG\nThe library can produce a PNG. Result will be a `ChunkyPNG::Image` instance.\n```ruby\nqrcode = RQRCode::QRCode.new(\"http://github.com/\")\n# With default options specified explicitly\npng = qrcode.as_png(\n          resize_gte_to: false,\n          resize_exactly_to: false,\n          fill: 'white',\n          color: 'black',\n          size: 120,\n          border_modules: 4,\n          file: false,\n          module_px_size: 6,\n          output_file: nil # path to write\n          )\n```\n## HTML Rendering\n### In your controller\n```ruby\n@qr = RQRCode::QRCode.new( 'https://github.com/whomwah/rqrcode', :size => 4, :level => :h )\n```\n### In your view\n```html\n<%= raw @qr.as_html %>\n```\n### CSS\n```css\ntable {\n  border-width: 0;\n  border-style: none;\n  border-color: #0000ff;\n  border-collapse: collapse;\n}\ntd {\n  border-left: solid 10px #000;\n  padding: 0; \n  margin: 0; \n  width: 0px; \n  height: 10px; \n}\ntd.black { border-color: #000; }\ntd.white { border-color: #fff; }\n```\n    \n## On the console\n```ruby\nqr = RQRCode::QRCode.new( 'my string to generate', :size => 4, :level => :h )\nputs qr.to_s\n```\nOutput:\n```\nxxxxxxx x  x x   x x  xx  xxxxxxx\nx     x  xxx  xxxxxx xxx  x     x\nx xxx x  xxxxx x       xx x xxx x\n... etc \n```\n## Doing your own rendering\n```ruby\nqr = RQRCode::QRCode.new( 'my string to generate', :size => 4, :level => :h )\nqr.modules.each do |row|\n    row.each do |col| \n        print col ? \"X\" : \" \"\n    end\n    print \"\\n\"\nend\n```\n## API Documentation\n[http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/rqrcode](http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/rqrcode)\n## Resources\n* wikipedia:: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_Code\n* Denso-Wave website:: http://www.denso-wave.com/qrcode/index-e.html\n* kaywa:: http://qrcode.kaywa.com\n## Authors\nOriginal author: Duncan Robertson\nSpecial thanks to the following people for submitting patches:\n* [Chris Mowforth](http://blog.99th.st)\n* [Daniel Schierbeck](https://github.com/dasch)\n* [Gioele Barabucci](https://github.com/gioele)\n* [Ken Collins](https://github.com/metaskills)\n* [Rob la Lau](https://github.com/ohreally)\n* [Tore Darell](http://tore.darell.no)\n* Vladislav Gorodetskiy\n## Contributing\n* Fork the project\n* Send a pull request\n* Don't touch the .gemspec, I'll do that when I release a new version\n## Copyright\nMIT License (http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.html)\nCopyright (c) 2008 Duncan Robertson \nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to\ndeal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the\nrights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or\nsell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n  \nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n   \nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

It won't give you fancy classes for everything, it'll simply aid you in sending the API requests, parsing the returned XML finally retuning you a Hash.\n## Installation\nAdd this line to your application's Gemfile:\n```ruby\ngem 'ruby-fogbugz'\n```\nAnd then execute:\n    $ bundle\nOr install it yourself as:\n    $ gem install ruby-fogbugz\n## Usage\nThe Fogbugz API works by sending HTTP GET parameters to the API where the GET parameter `cmd` invokes a Fogbugz method, e.g. `cmd=listProjects` to get a list of all projects, `cmd`s then accept further arguments, such as listing all cases assigned to a specific person:\n    cmd=search&ixAssignedTo=2&cols=sTitle,sStatus # list all cases associated to the user with ID of 2 in Fogbugz\nIn `ruby-fogbugz` that request would be:\n```ruby\nfogbugz.command(:search, :ixAssignedTo => 2, :cols => \"sTitle,sStatus\")\n```\nReturns your parsed XML:\n```ruby\n{\n  \"description\"=>\"All open cases assigned to Simon Eskildsen\",\n  \"cases\" => {\n    \"case\"=> [\n      {\"ixBug\"=>\"143\", \"sTitle\"=>\"Write ruby-fogbugz documentation\",\n      \"sStatus\"=>\"active\", \"operations\"=>\"edit,assign,resolve,email,remind\"},\n      {\"ixBug\"=>\"146\", \"sTitle\"=>\"Tame a unicorn\", \"sStatus\"=>\"active\",\n      \"operations\"=>\"edit,assign,resolve,email,remind\"},\n      {\"ixBug\"=>\"152\", \"sTitle\"=>\"Hug a walrus\", \"sStatus\"=>\"active\",\n      \"operations\"=>\"edit,assign,resolve,email,remind\"},\n    ], \"count\"=>\"3\"\n  }\n}\n```\nAs you see, `ruby-fogbugz` is without magic and leaves most to the user.\n`cmd` is the first argument to `Fogbugz#command`, the second argument being a `Hash` of additional GET arguments to specify the request further. You can see available `cmd`'s and arguments at the [Fogbugz API documentation][fad].\nAll Fogbugz API requests require a token. Thus `#authenticate` must be called on the `ruby-fogbugz` instance before `#command`'s are sent:\n```ruby\nrequire 'fogbugz'\nfogbugz = Fogbugz::Interface.new(:email => 'my@email.com', :password => 'seekrit', :uri => 'https://company.fogbugz.com') # remember to use https!\nfogbugz.authenticate # token is now automatically attached to every future requests\np fogbugz.command(:listPeople)\n```\n`#authenticate` fetches a new token every time. To avoid the extra request,\nobtain a token:\n```ruby\nrequire 'fogbugz'\nfogbugz = Fogbugz::Interface.new(:email => 'my@email.com', :password => 'seekrit', :uri => 'https://company.fogbugz.com') # remember to use https!\nfogbugz.authenticate # token is now automatically attached to every future requests\nputs \"Token: #{fogbugz.token}\"\n```\nRun the script, and initialize with the returned token:\n```ruby\nfogbugz = Fogbugz::Interface.new(:token => \"some token to use from now on\", :uri => 'https://company.fogbugz.com') # remember to use https!\n```\n### Attachments\nThis library supports multipart file uploads to include attachments in your API request. A multipart request body is created (using the [multipart-post][mpp] gem) if `File1` is found in the command parameters. Files can be attached as follows:\n```ruby\nfogbugz.command(:new, sProject: \"SomeProject\", sArea: \"someArea\", sTitle: \"Case title\", File1: UploadIO.new(f, \"text/plain\", \"someFile.rb\"))\n```\n[fad]:http://fogbugz.stackexchange.com/fogbugz-xml-api\n[mpp]:https://github.com/nicksieger/multipart-post\n## License\n`ruby-fogbugz` is released under the MIT license.","notice":""},{"name":"ruby-magic","version":"0.5.4","licenses":["Apache 2.0"],"texts":"\n                                 Apache License\n                           Version 2.0, January 2004\n                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION\n   1.

It outputs\ns-expressions which can be manipulated and converted back to ruby via\nthe ruby2ruby gem.\nAs an example:\n    def conditional1 arg1\n      return 1 if arg1 == 0\n      return 0\n    end\nbecomes:\n    s(:defn, :conditional1, s(:args, :arg1),\n      s(:if,\n        s(:call, s(:lvar, :arg1), :==, s(:lit, 0)),\n        s(:return, s(:lit, 1)),\n        nil),\n      s(:return, s(:lit, 0)))\nTested against 801,039 files from the latest of all rubygems (as of 2013-05):\n* 1.8 parser is at 99.9739% accuracy, 3.651 sigma\n* 1.9 parser is at 99.9940% accuracy, 4.013 sigma\n* 2.0 parser is at 99.9939% accuracy, 4.008 sigma\n== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:\n* Pure ruby, no compiles.\n* Includes preceding comment data for defn/defs/class/module nodes!\n* Incredibly simple interface.\n* Output is 100% equivalent to ParseTree.\n  * Can utilize PT's SexpProcessor and UnifiedRuby for language processing.\n* Known Issue: Speed is now pretty good, but can always improve:\n  * RP parses a corpus of 3702 files in 125s (avg 108 Kb/s)\n  * MRI+PT parsed the same in 67.38s (avg 200.89 Kb/s)\n* Known Issue: Code is much better, but still has a long way to go.\n* Known Issue: Totally awesome.\n* Known Issue: line number values can be slightly off. Parsing LR sucks.\n== SYNOPSIS:\n  RubyParser.new.parse \"1+1\"\n  # => s(:call, s(:lit, 1), :+, s(:lit, 1))\nYou can also use Ruby19Parser, Ruby18Parser, or RubyParser.for_current_ruby:\n  RubyParser.for_current_ruby.parse \"1+1\"\n  # => s(:call, s(:lit, 1), :+, s(:lit, 1))\n== DEVELOPER NOTES:\nTo add a new version:\n* New parser should be generated from lib/ruby_parser.yy.\n* Extend lib/ruby_parser.yy with new class name.\n* Add new version number to V2 in Rakefile for rule creation.\n* Require generated parser in lib/ruby_parser.rb.\n* Add empty TestRubyParserShared##Plus module and TestRubyParserV## to test/test_ruby_parser.rb.\n* Extend Manifest.txt with generated file names.\n* Extend sexp_processor's pt_testcase.rb to match version\n  * add_19tests needs to have the version added\n  * VER_RE needs to have the regexp expanded\nUntil all of these are done, you won't have a clean test run.\n== REQUIREMENTS:\n* ruby. woot.\n* sexp_processor for Sexp and SexpProcessor classes, and testing.\n* racc full package for parser development (compiling .y to .rb).\n== INSTALL:\n* sudo gem install ruby_parser\n== LICENSE:\n(The MIT License)\nCopyright (c) Ryan Davis, seattle.rb\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.","notice":""},{"name":"rubyntlm","version":"0.6.3","licenses":["MIT"],"texts":"The MIT License (MIT)\nCopyright (c) 2013 Paul Morton, Matt Zukowski, Kohei Kajimoto\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\nthis software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of\nthe Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so,\nsubject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS\nFOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

No need to do `require \"zip/zip\"` and `Zip` prefix in class names removed.\nIf you have issues with any third-party gems that require an old version of rubyzip, you can use this workaround:\n```ruby\ngem 'rubyzip', '>= 1.0.0' # will load new rubyzip version\ngem 'zip-zip' # will load compatibility for old rubyzip API.\n```\n## Requirements\n- Ruby 2.4 or greater (for rubyzip 2.0; use 1.x for older rubies)\n## Installation\nRubyzip is available on RubyGems:\n```\ngem install rubyzip\n```\nOr in your Gemfile:\n```ruby\ngem 'rubyzip'\n```\n## Usage\n### Basic zip archive creation\n```ruby\nrequire 'rubygems'\nrequire 'zip'\nfolder = \"Users/me/Desktop/stuff_to_zip\"\ninput_filenames = ['image.jpg', 'description.txt', 'stats.csv']\nzipfile_name = \"/Users/me/Desktop/archive.zip\"\nZip::File.open(zipfile_name, Zip::File::CREATE) do |zipfile|\n  input_filenames.each do |filename|\n    # Two arguments:\n    # - The name of the file as it will appear in the archive\n    # - The original file, including the path to find it\n    zipfile.add(filename, File.join(folder, filename))\n  end\n  zipfile.get_output_stream(\"myFile\") { |f| f.write \"myFile contains just this\" }\nend\n```\n### Zipping a directory recursively\nCopy from [here](https://github.com/rubyzip/rubyzip/blob/9d891f7353e66052283562d3e252fe380bb4b199/samples/example_recursive.rb)\n```ruby\nrequire 'zip'\n# This is a simple example which uses rubyzip to\n# recursively generate a zip file from the contents of\n# a specified directory. The directory itself is not\n# included in the archive, rather just its contents.\n#\n# Usage:\n#   directory_to_zip = \"/tmp/input\"\n#   output_file = \"/tmp/out.zip\"\n#   zf = ZipFileGenerator.new(directory_to_zip, output_file)\n#   zf.write()\nclass ZipFileGenerator\n  # Initialize with the directory to zip and the location of the output archive.\n  def initialize(input_dir, output_file)\n    @input_dir = input_dir\n    @output_file = output_file\n  end\n  # Zip the input directory.\n  def write\n    entries = Dir.entries(@input_dir) - %w[. ..]\n    ::Zip::File.open(@output_file, ::Zip::File::CREATE) do |zipfile|\n      write_entries entries, '', zipfile\n    end\n  end\n  private\n  # A helper method to make the recursion work.\n  def write_entries(entries, path, zipfile)\n    entries.each do |e|\n      zipfile_path = path == '' ? e : File.join(path, e)\n      disk_file_path = File.join(@input_dir, zipfile_path)\n      if File.directory? disk_file_path\n        recursively_deflate_directory(disk_file_path, zipfile, zipfile_path)\n      else\n        put_into_archive(disk_file_path, zipfile, zipfile_path)\n      end\n    end\n  end\n  def recursively_deflate_directory(disk_file_path, zipfile, zipfile_path)\n    zipfile.mkdir zipfile_path\n    subdir = Dir.entries(disk_file_path) - %w[. ..]\n    write_entries subdir, zipfile_path, zipfile\n  end\n  def put_into_archive(disk_file_path, zipfile, zipfile_path)\n    zipfile.add(zipfile_path, disk_file_path)\n  end\nend\n```\n### Save zip archive entries in sorted by name state\nTo save zip archives in sorted order like below, you need to set `::Zip.sort_entries` to `true`\n```\nVegetable/\nVegetable/bean\nVegetable/carrot\nVegetable/celery\nfruit/\nfruit/apple\nfruit/kiwi\nfruit/mango\nfruit/orange\n```\nAfter this, entries in the zip archive will be saved in ordered state.\n### Default permissions of zip archives\nOn Posix file systems the default file permissions applied to a new archive\nare (0666 - umask), which mimics the behavior of standard tools such as `touch`.\nOn Windows the default file permissions are set to 0644 as suggested by the\n[Ruby File documentation](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.2/File.html).\nWhen modifying a zip archive the file permissions of the archive are preserved.\n### Reading a Zip file\n```ruby\nMAX_SIZE = 1024**2 # 1MiB (but of course you can increase this)\nZip::File.open('foo.zip') do |zip_file|\n  # Handle entries one by one\n  zip_file.each do |entry|\n    puts \"Extracting #{entry.name}\"\n    raise 'File too large when extracted' if entry.size > MAX_SIZE\n    # Extract to file or directory based on name in the archive\n    entry.extract\n    # Read into memory\n    content = entry.get_input_stream.read\n  end\n  # Find specific entry\n  entry = zip_file.glob('*.csv').first\n  raise 'File too large when extracted' if entry.size > MAX_SIZE\n  puts entry.get_input_stream.read\nend\n```\n#### Notice about ::Zip::InputStream\n`::Zip::InputStream` usable for fast reading zip file content because it not read Central directory.\nBut there is one exception when it is not working - General Purpose Flag Bit 3.\n> If bit 3 (0x08) of the general-purpose flags field is set, then the CRC-32 and file sizes are not known when the header is written. The fields in the local header are filled with zero, and the CRC-32 and size are appended in a 12-byte structure (optionally preceded by a 4-byte signature) immediately after the compressed data\nIf `::Zip::InputStream` finds such entry in the zip archive it will raise an exception.\n### Password Protection (Experimental)\nRubyzip supports reading/writing zip files with traditional zip encryption (a.k.a. \"ZipCrypto\"). AES encryption is not yet supported. It can be used with buffer streams, e.g.:\n```ruby\nZip::OutputStream.write_buffer(::StringIO.new(''), Zip::TraditionalEncrypter.new('password')) do |out|\n  out.put_next_entry(\"my_file.txt\")\n  out.write my_data\nend.string\n```\nThis is an experimental feature and the interface for encryption may change in future versions.\n## Known issues\n### Modify docx file with rubyzip\nUse `write_buffer` instead `open`. Thanks to @jondruse\n```ruby\nbuffer = Zip::OutputStream.write_buffer do |out|\n  @zip_file.entries.each do |e|\n    unless [DOCUMENT_FILE_PATH, RELS_FILE_PATH].include?(e.name)\n      out.put_next_entry(e.name)\n      out.write e.get_input_stream.read\n     end\n  end\n  out.put_next_entry(DOCUMENT_FILE_PATH)\n  out.write xml_doc.to_xml(:indent => 0).gsub(\"\\n\",\"\")\n  out.put_next_entry(RELS_FILE_PATH)\n  out.write rels.to_xml(:indent => 0).gsub(\"\\n\",\"\")\nend\nFile.open(new_path, \"wb\") {|f| f.write(buffer.string) }\n```\n## Configuration\n### Existing Files\nBy default, rubyzip will not overwrite files if they already exist inside of the extracted path. To change this behavior, you may specify a configuration option like so:\n```ruby\nZip.on_exists_proc = true\n```\nIf you're using rubyzip with rails, consider placing this snippet of code in an initializer file such as `config/initializers/rubyzip.rb`\nAdditionally, if you want to configure rubyzip to overwrite existing files while creating a .zip file, you can do so with the following:\n```ruby\nZip.continue_on_exists_proc = true\n```\n### Non-ASCII Names\nIf you want to store non-english names and want to open them on Windows(pre 7) you need to set this option:\n```ruby\nZip.unicode_names = true\n```\nSometimes file names inside zip contain non-ASCII characters. If you can assume which encoding was used for such names and want to be able to find such entries using `find_entry` then you can force assumed encoding like so:\n```ruby\nZip.force_entry_names_encoding = 'UTF-8'\n```\nAllowed encoding names are the same as accepted by `String#force_encoding`\n### Date Validation\nSome zip files might have an invalid date format, which will raise a warning. You can hide this warning with the following setting:\n```ruby\nZip.warn_invalid_date = false\n```\n### Size Validation\nBy default (in rubyzip >= 2.0), rubyzip's `extract` method checks that an entry's reported uncompressed size is not (significantly) smaller than its actual size. This is to help you protect your application against [zip bombs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_bomb). Before `extract`ing an entry, you should check that its size is in the range you expect. For example, if your application supports processing up to 100 files at once, each up to 10MiB, your zip extraction code might look like:\n```ruby\nMAX_FILE_SIZE = 10 * 1024**2 # 10MiB\nMAX_FILES = 100\nZip::File.open('foo.zip') do |zip_file|\n  num_files = 0\n  zip_file.each do |entry|\n    num_files += 1 if entry.file?\n    raise 'Too many extracted files' if num_files > MAX_FILES\n    raise 'File too large when extracted' if entry.size > MAX_FILE_SIZE\n    entry.extract\n  end\nend\n```\nIf you need to extract zip files that report incorrect uncompressed sizes and you really trust them not too be too large, you can disable this setting with\n```ruby\nZip.validate_entry_sizes = false\n```\nNote that if you use the lower level `Zip::InputStream` interface, `rubyzip` does *not* check the entry `size`s. In this case, the caller is responsible for making sure it does not read more data than expected from the input stream.\n### Default Compression\nYou can set the default compression level like so:\n```ruby\nZip.default_compression = Zlib::DEFAULT_COMPRESSION\n```\nIt defaults to `Zlib::DEFAULT_COMPRESSION`. Possible values are `Zlib::BEST_COMPRESSION`, `Zlib::DEFAULT_COMPRESSION` and `Zlib::NO_COMPRESSION`\n### Zip64 Support\nBy default, Zip64 support is disabled for writing. To enable it do this:\n```ruby\nZip.write_zip64_support = true\n```\n_NOTE_: If you will enable Zip64 writing then you will need zip extractor with Zip64 support to extract archive.\n### Block Form\nYou can set multiple settings at the same time by using a block:\n```ruby\n  Zip.setup do |c|\n    c.on_exists_proc = true\n    c.continue_on_exists_proc = true\n    c.unicode_names = true\n    c.default_compression = Zlib::BEST_COMPRESSION\n  end\n```\n## Developing\nTo run the test you need to do this:\n```\nbundle install\nrake\n```\n## Website and Project Home\nhttp://github.com/rubyzip/rubyzip\nhttp://rdoc.info/github/rubyzip/rubyzip/master/frames\n## Authors\nAlexander Simonov ( alex at simonov.me)\nAlan Harper ( alan at aussiegeek.net)\nThomas Sondergaard (thomas at sondergaard.cc)\nTechnorama Ltd.

By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\t\t    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\t\t\t    NO WARRANTY\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\t\t     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\t    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Of course, the commands you use may\nbe called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be\nmouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\nnecessary.

It also counts\n as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\n the version number 2.1.]\n                            Preamble\n  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\nfreedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\nfree software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\nspecially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\nFree Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\ncan use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\nthis license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\nstrategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\nnot price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\nyou have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\nfor this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\nit if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\nit in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\nthese things.\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\ndistributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\nrights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\nyou if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\n  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\nor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\nyou.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\ncode.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\ncomplete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\nwith the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\nit.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\nlibrary, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\npermission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\n  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\nthere is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\nmodified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\nthat what they have is not the original version, so that the original\nauthor's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\nintroduced by others.\n\f\n  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\nany free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\neffectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\nrestrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\nany patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\nconsistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\n  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\nordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\nis quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\nthis license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\nlibraries into non-free programs.\n  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\na shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\ncombined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\nGeneral Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\nentire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\nPublic License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\nthe library.\n  We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it\ndoes Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\nPublic License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\nof an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\nare the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\nlibraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\nspecial circumstances.\n  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\nencourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes\na de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be\nallowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\nlibrary does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\ncase, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\nsoftware only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\n  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\nprograms enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\nfree software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\nnon-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\noperating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\nsystem.\n  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\nusers' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\nlinked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\nthat program using a modified version of the Library.\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\n\"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The\nformer contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\nbe combined with the library in order to run.\n\f\n                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\nprogram which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\nother authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\nthis Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\").\nEach licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n  A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data\nprepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\n(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\n  The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work\nwhich has been distributed under these terms.  A \"work based on the\nLibrary\" means either the Library or any derivative work under\ncopyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\nportion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\nstraightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\nincluded without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n  \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\nall the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\ninterface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation\nand installation of the library.\n  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\nsuch a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\non the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\nwriting it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\nand what the program that uses the Library does.\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\ncomplete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\nyou conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\nappropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\nall the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\nwarranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\nLibrary.\n  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\nand you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\nfee.\n\f\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\n    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\n    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\n    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\n    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\n    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\n    in the event an application does not supply such function or\n    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\n    its purpose remains meaningful.\n    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\n    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\n    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\n    application-supplied function or table used by this function must\n    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\n    root function must still compute square roots.)\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\nit.\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Library.\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\nwith the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\nLicense instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\nthis, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\nthat they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\ninstead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\nordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\nthat version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\nthese notices.\n\f\n  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\nthat copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\nsubsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\n  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\nthe Library into a program that is not a library.\n  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\nderivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\nunder the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\nit with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\nmust be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\nmedium customarily used for software interchange.\n  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\nfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\nsource code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\ndistribute the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\nLibrary, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\nlinked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".  Such a\nwork, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\ntherefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n  However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library\ncreates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\ncontains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the\nlibrary\".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\nSection 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\n  When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file\nthat is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\nderivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\nWhether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\nlinked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\nthreshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\n  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\nstructure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\nfunctions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\nfile is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\nwork.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\nLibrary will still fall under Section 6.)\n  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\ndistribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\nAny executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\nwhether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\n\f\n  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\nlink a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a\nwork containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\nunder terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\nmodification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications.\n  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\nLibrary is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\nthis License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\nduring execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\ncopyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\ndirecting the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\nof these things:\n    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\n    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\n    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\n    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\n    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that\n    uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the\n    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\n    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\n    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\n    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\n    to use the modified definitions.)\n    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\n    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\n    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\n    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\n    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\n    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\n    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at\n    least three years, to give the same user the materials\n    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more\n    than the cost of performing this distribution.\n    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\n    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\n    specified materials from the same place.\n    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\n    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\n  For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the\nLibrary\" must include any data and utility programs needed for\nreproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\nthe materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\nnormally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\ncomponents (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\nwhich the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\nthe executable.\n  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\nrestrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\naccompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\nuse both them and the Library together in an executable that you\ndistribute.\n\f\n  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side-by-side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\nlibrary, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\nthe Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\npermitted, and provided that you do these two things:\n    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\n    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\n    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\n    Sections above.\n    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\n    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\n    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\nthe Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\nattempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\ndistribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\nrights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\nor rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\nterminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Library or works based on it.\n  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\nsubject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\nthis License.\n\f\n  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\nparticular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,\nand the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add\nan explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,\nso that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus\nexcluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if\nwritten in the body of this License.\n  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\nversions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\nSuch new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\nbut may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\n\"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that version or of any later version published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\nlicense version number, you may choose any version ever published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.\n\f\n  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\nwrite to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\ncopyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\nSoftware Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\ndecision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\nof all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\nand reuse of software generally.\n                            NO WARRANTY\n  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\nWARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\nEXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\nOTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\nKIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\nLIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\nTHE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\nWRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\nAND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\nFOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\nCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\nLIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\nRENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\nFAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\nSUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\nDAMAGES.\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\f\n           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\n  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\neveryone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\nredistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the\nordinary General Public License).\n  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is\nsafest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the\n\"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\n    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\n    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\n    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\t\t    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\t\t\t    NO WARRANTY\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\t\t     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\t    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Of course, the commands you use may\nbe called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be\nmouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\nnecessary.

It also counts\n as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\n the version number 2.1.]\n                            Preamble\n  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\nfreedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\nfree software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\nspecially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\nFree Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\ncan use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\nthis license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\nstrategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\nnot price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\nyou have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\nfor this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\nit if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\nit in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\nthese things.\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\ndistributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\nrights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\nyou if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\n  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\nor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\nyou.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\ncode.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\ncomplete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\nwith the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\nit.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\nlibrary, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\npermission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\n  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\nthere is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\nmodified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\nthat what they have is not the original version, so that the original\nauthor's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\nintroduced by others.\n\f\n  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\nany free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\neffectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\nrestrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\nany patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\nconsistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\n  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\nordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\nis quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\nthis license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\nlibraries into non-free programs.\n  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\na shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\ncombined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\nGeneral Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\nentire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\nPublic License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\nthe library.\n  We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it\ndoes Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\nPublic License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\nof an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\nare the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\nlibraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\nspecial circumstances.\n  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\nencourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes\na de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be\nallowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\nlibrary does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\ncase, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\nsoftware only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\n  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\nprograms enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\nfree software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\nnon-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\noperating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\nsystem.\n  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\nusers' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\nlinked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\nthat program using a modified version of the Library.\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\n\"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The\nformer contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\nbe combined with the library in order to run.\n\f\n                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\nprogram which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\nother authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\nthis Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\").\nEach licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n  A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data\nprepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\n(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\n  The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work\nwhich has been distributed under these terms.  A \"work based on the\nLibrary\" means either the Library or any derivative work under\ncopyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\nportion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\nstraightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\nincluded without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n  \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\nall the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\ninterface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation\nand installation of the library.\n  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\nsuch a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\non the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\nwriting it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\nand what the program that uses the Library does.\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\ncomplete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\nyou conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\nappropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\nall the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\nwarranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\nLibrary.\n  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\nand you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\nfee.\n\f\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\n    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\n    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\n    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\n    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\n    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\n    in the event an application does not supply such function or\n    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\n    its purpose remains meaningful.\n    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\n    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\n    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\n    application-supplied function or table used by this function must\n    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\n    root function must still compute square roots.)\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\nit.\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Library.\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\nwith the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\nLicense instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\nthis, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\nthat they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\ninstead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\nordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\nthat version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\nthese notices.\n\f\n  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\nthat copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\nsubsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\n  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\nthe Library into a program that is not a library.\n  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\nderivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\nunder the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\nit with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\nmust be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\nmedium customarily used for software interchange.\n  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\nfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\nsource code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\ndistribute the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\nLibrary, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\nlinked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".  Such a\nwork, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\ntherefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n  However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library\ncreates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\ncontains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the\nlibrary\".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\nSection 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\n  When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file\nthat is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\nderivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\nWhether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\nlinked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\nthreshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\n  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\nstructure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\nfunctions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\nfile is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\nwork.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\nLibrary will still fall under Section 6.)\n  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\ndistribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\nAny executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\nwhether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\n\f\n  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\nlink a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a\nwork containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\nunder terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\nmodification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications.\n  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\nLibrary is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\nthis License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\nduring execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\ncopyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\ndirecting the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\nof these things:\n    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\n    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\n    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\n    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\n    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that\n    uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the\n    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\n    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\n    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\n    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\n    to use the modified definitions.)\n    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\n    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\n    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\n    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\n    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\n    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\n    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at\n    least three years, to give the same user the materials\n    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more\n    than the cost of performing this distribution.\n    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\n    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\n    specified materials from the same place.\n    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\n    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\n  For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the\nLibrary\" must include any data and utility programs needed for\nreproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\nthe materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\nnormally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\ncomponents (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\nwhich the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\nthe executable.\n  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\nrestrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\naccompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\nuse both them and the Library together in an executable that you\ndistribute.\n\f\n  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side-by-side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\nlibrary, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\nthe Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\npermitted, and provided that you do these two things:\n    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\n    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\n    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\n    Sections above.\n    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\n    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\n    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\nthe Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\nattempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\ndistribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\nrights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\nor rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\nterminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Library or works based on it.\n  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\nsubject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\nthis License.\n\f\n  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\nparticular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,\nand the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add\nan explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,\nso that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus\nexcluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if\nwritten in the body of this License.\n  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\nversions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\nSuch new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\nbut may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\n\"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that version or of any later version published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\nlicense version number, you may choose any version ever published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.\n\f\n  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\nwrite to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\ncopyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\nSoftware Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\ndecision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\nof all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\nand reuse of software generally.\n                            NO WARRANTY\n  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\nWARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\nEXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\nOTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\nKIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\nLIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\nTHE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\nWRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\nAND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\nFOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\nCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\nLIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\nRENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\nFAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\nSUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\nDAMAGES.\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\f\n           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\n  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\neveryone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\nredistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the\nordinary General Public License).\n  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is\nsafest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the\n\"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\n    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\n    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\n    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Sexp, SexpProcessor, Environment, etc... all\nfor your language processing pleasure.\n== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:\n* Includes SexpProcessor and CompositeSexpProcessor.\n  * Allows you to write very clean filters.\n* Includes MethodBasedSexpProcessor\n  * Makes writing language processors even easier!\n* Sexp provides a simple and clean interface to creating and manipulating ASTs.\n  * Includes new pattern matching system.\n== SYNOPSIS:\nYou can use SexpProcessor to do all kinds of language processing. Here\nis a simple example of a simple documentation printer:\n  class ArrrDoc < MethodBasedSexpProcessor\n    def process_class exp\n      super do\n        puts \"#{self.klass_name}: #{exp.comments}\"\n      end\n    end\n    def process_defn exp\n      super do\n        args, *_body = exp\n        puts \"#{self.method_name}(#{process_args args}): #{exp.comments}\"\n      end\n    end\n  end\nSexp provides a lot of power with the new pattern matching system.\nHere is an example that parses all the test files using RubyParser and\nthen quickly finds all the test methods and prints their names:\n  >> require \"ruby_parser\";\n  >> rp = RubyParser.new;\n  >> matcher = Sexp::Matcher.parse \"(defn [m /^test_/] ___)\"\n  => q(:defn, m(/^test_/), ___)\n  >> paths = Dir[\"test/**/*.rb\"];\n  >> sexps = s(:block, *paths.map { |path| rp.process File.read(path), path });\n  >> (sexps / matcher).size\n  => 189\n  ?> (sexps / matcher).map { |(_, name, *_rest)| name }.sort\n  => [:test_all, :test_amp, :test_and_satisfy_eh, :test_any_search, ...]\n== REQUIREMENTS:\n* rubygems\n== INSTALL:\n* sudo gem install sexp_processor\n== LICENSE:\n(The MIT License)\nCopyright (c) Ryan Davis, seattle.rb\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.","notice":""},{"name":"sha.js","version":"2.4.10","licenses":["MIT"],"texts":"Copyright (c) 2013-2014 sha.js contributors\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, \nto any person obtaining a copy of this software and \nassociated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to \ndeal in the Software without restriction, including \nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, \nmerge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell \ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom \nthe Software is furnished to do so, \nsubject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice \nshall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, \nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES \nOF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. \nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR \nANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, \nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE \nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.","notice":""},{"name":"shallow-clone","version":"3.0.1","licenses":["MIT"],"texts":"The MIT License (MIT)\nCopyright (c) 2015-present, Jon Schlinkert.\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

This will allow you to toggle the debug output for different parts of your module as well as the module as a whole.\nExample _app.js_:\n```js\nvar debug = require('debug')('http')\n  , http = require('http')\n  , name = 'My App';\n// fake app\ndebug('booting %s', name);\nhttp.createServer(function(req, res){\n  debug(req.method + ' ' + req.url);\n  res.end('hello\\n');\n}).listen(3000, function(){\n  debug('listening');\n});\n// fake worker of some kind\nrequire('./worker');\n```\nExample _worker.js_:\n```js\nvar debug = require('debug')('worker');\nsetInterval(function(){\n  debug('doing some work');\n}, 1000);\n```\n The __DEBUG__ environment variable is then used to enable these based on space or comma-delimited names. Here are some examples:\n  ![debug http and worker](http://f.cl.ly/items/18471z1H402O24072r1J/Screenshot.png)\n  ![debug worker](http://f.cl.ly/items/1X413v1a3M0d3C2c1E0i/Screenshot.png)\n#### Windows note\n On Windows the environment variable is set using the `set` command.\n ```cmd\n set DEBUG=*,-not_this\n ```\n Note that PowerShell uses different syntax to set environment variables.\n ```cmd\n $env:DEBUG = \"*,-not_this\"\n  ```\nThen, run the program to be debugged as usual.\n## Millisecond diff\n  When actively developing an application it can be useful to see when the time spent between one `debug()` call and the next. Suppose for example you invoke `debug()` before requesting a resource, and after as well, the \"+NNNms\" will show you how much time was spent between calls.\n  ![](http://f.cl.ly/items/2i3h1d3t121M2Z1A3Q0N/Screenshot.png)\n  When stdout is not a TTY, `Date#toUTCString()` is used, making it more useful for logging the debug information as shown below:\n  ![](http://f.cl.ly/items/112H3i0e0o0P0a2Q2r11/Screenshot.png)\n## Conventions\n  If you're using this in one or more of your libraries, you _should_ use the name of your library so that developers may toggle debugging as desired without guessing names. If you have more than one debuggers you _should_ prefix them with your library name and use \":\" to separate features. For example \"bodyParser\" from Connect would then be \"connect:bodyParser\".\n## Wildcards\n  The `*` character may be used as a wildcard. Suppose for example your library has debuggers named \"connect:bodyParser\", \"connect:compress\", \"connect:session\", instead of listing all three with `DEBUG=connect:bodyParser,connect:compress,connect:session`, you may simply do `DEBUG=connect:*`, or to run everything using this module simply use `DEBUG=*`.\n  You can also exclude specific debuggers by prefixing them with a \"-\" character.  For example, `DEBUG=*,-connect:*` would include all debuggers except those starting with \"connect:\".\n## Environment Variables\n  When running through Node.js, you can set a few environment variables that will\n  change the behavior of the debug logging:\n| Name      | Purpose                                         |\n|-----------|-------------------------------------------------|\n| `DEBUG`   | Enables/disables specific debugging namespaces. |\n| `DEBUG_COLORS`| Whether or not to use colors in the debug output. |\n| `DEBUG_DEPTH` | Object inspection depth. |\n| `DEBUG_SHOW_HIDDEN` | Shows hidden properties on inspected objects. |\n  __Note:__ The environment variables beginning with `DEBUG_` end up being\n  converted into an Options object that gets used with `%o`/`%O` formatters.\n  See the Node.js documentation for\n  [`util.inspect()`](https://nodejs.org/api/util.html#util_util_inspect_object_options)\n  for the complete list.\n## Formatters\n  Debug uses [printf-style](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Printf_format_string) formatting. Below are the officially supported formatters:\n| Formatter | Representation |\n|-----------|----------------|\n| `%O`      | Pretty-print an Object on multiple lines. |\n| `%o`      | Pretty-print an Object all on a single line. |\n| `%s`      | String. |\n| `%d`      | Number (both integer and float). |\n| `%j`      | JSON. Replaced with the string '[Circular]' if the argument contains circular references. |\n| `%%`      | Single percent sign ('%'). This does not consume an argument. |\n### Custom formatters\n  You can add custom formatters by extending the `debug.formatters` object. For example, if you wanted to add support for rendering a Buffer as hex with `%h`, you could do something like:\n```js\nconst createDebug = require('debug')\ncreateDebug.formatters.h = (v) => {\n  return v.toString('hex')\n}\n// â¦elsewhere\nconst debug = createDebug('foo')\ndebug('this is hex: %h', new Buffer('hello world'))\n//   foo this is hex: 68656c6c6f20776f726c6421 +0ms\n```\n## Browser support\n  You can build a browser-ready script using [browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify),\n  or just use the [browserify-as-a-service](https://wzrd.in/) [build](https://wzrd.in/standalone/debug@latest),\n  if you don't want to build it yourself.\n  Debug's enable state is currently persisted by `localStorage`.\n  Consider the situation shown below where you have `worker:a` and `worker:b`,\n  and wish to debug both. You can enable this using `localStorage.debug`:\n```js\nlocalStorage.debug = 'worker:*'\n```\nAnd then refresh the page.\n```js\na = debug('worker:a');\nb = debug('worker:b');\nsetInterval(function(){\n  a('doing some work');\n}, 1000);\nsetInterval(function(){\n  b('doing some work');\n}, 1200);\n```\n#### Web Inspector Colors\n  Colors are also enabled on \"Web Inspectors\" that understand the `%c` formatting\n  option. These are WebKit web inspectors, Firefox ([since version\n  31](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2014/05/editable-box-model-multiple-selection-sublime-text-keys-much-more-firefox-developer-tools-episode-31/))\n  and the Firebug plugin for Firefox (any version).\n  Colored output looks something like:\n  ![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/71256/3139768/b98c5fd8-e8ef-11e3-862a-f7253b6f47c6.png)\n## Output streams\n  By default `debug` will log to stderr, however this can be configured per-namespace by overriding the `log` method:\nExample _stdout.js_:\n```js\nvar debug = require('debug');\nvar error = debug('app:error');\n// by default stderr is used\nerror('goes to stderr!');\nvar log = debug('app:log');\n// set this namespace to log via console.log\nlog.log = console.log.bind(console); // don't forget to bind to console!\nlog('goes to stdout');\nerror('still goes to stderr!');\n// set all output to go via console.info\n// overrides all per-namespace log settings\ndebug.log = console.info.bind(console);\nerror('now goes to stdout via console.info');\nlog('still goes to stdout, but via console.info now');\n```\n## Authors\n - TJ Holowaychuk\n - Nathan Rajlich\n - Andrew Rhyne\n \n## Backers\nSupport us with a monthly donation and help us continue our activities.

Can be set to `'vertical'`, `'horizontal'`, or a function, which will be called whenever a target is dragged over. Must return `'vertical'` or `'horizontal'`.\n[Read more](https://github.com/SortableJS/Sortable/wiki/Swap-Thresholds-and-Direction#direction)\nExample of direction detection for vertical list that includes full column and half column elements:\n```js\nSortable.create(el, {\n\tdirection: function(evt, target, dragEl) {\n\t\tif (target !== null && target.className.includes('half-column') && dragEl.className.includes('half-column')) {\n\t\t\treturn 'horizontal';\n\t\t}\n\t\treturn 'vertical';\n\t}\n});\n```\n---\n#### `touchStartThreshold` option\nThis option is similar to `fallbackTolerance` option.\nWhen the `delay` option is set, some phones with very sensitive touch displays like the Samsung Galaxy S8 will fire\nunwanted touchmove events even when your finger is not moving, resulting in the sort not triggering.\nThis option sets the minimum pointer movement that must occur before the delayed sorting is cancelled.\nValues between 3 to 5 are good.\n---\n#### `disabled` options\nDisables the sortable if set to `true`.\nDemo: https://jsbin.com/sewokud/edit?js,output\n```js\nvar sortable = Sortable.create(list);\ndocument.getElementById(\"switcher\").onclick = function () {\n\tvar state = sortable.option(\"disabled\"); // get\n\tsortable.option(\"disabled\", !state); // set\n};\n```\n---\n#### `handle` option\nTo make list items draggable, Sortable disables text selection by the user.\nThat's not always desirable. To allow text selection, define a drag handler,\nwhich is an area of every list element that allows it to be dragged around.\nDemo: https://jsbin.com/numakuh/edit?html,js,output\n```js\nSortable.create(el, {\n\thandle: \".my-handle\"\n});\n```\n```html\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"my-handle\">::</span> list item text one\n\t<li><span class=\"my-handle\">::</span> list item text two\n</ul>\n```\n```css\n.my-handle {\n\tcursor: move;\n\tcursor: -webkit-grabbing;\n}\n```\n---\n#### `filter` option\n```js\nSortable.create(list, {\n\tfilter: \".js-remove, .js-edit\",\n\tonFilter: function (evt) {\n\t\tvar item = evt.item,\n\t\t\tctrl = evt.target;\n\t\tif (Sortable.utils.is(ctrl, \".js-remove\")) {  // Click on remove button\n\t\t\titem.parentNode.removeChild(item); // remove sortable item\n\t\t}\n\t\telse if (Sortable.utils.is(ctrl, \".js-edit\")) {  // Click on edit link\n\t\t\t// ...\n\t\t}\n\t}\n})\n```\n---\n#### `ghostClass` option\nClass name for the drop placeholder (default `sortable-ghost`).\nDemo: https://jsbin.com/henuyiw/edit?css,js,output\n```css\n.ghost {\n  opacity: 0.4;\n}\n```\n```js\nSortable.create(list, {\n  ghostClass: \"ghost\"\n});\n```\n---\n#### `chosenClass` option\nClass name for the chosen item  (default `sortable-chosen`).\nDemo: https://jsbin.com/hoqufox/edit?css,js,output\n```css\n.chosen {\n  color: #fff;\n  background-color: #c00;\n}\n```\n```js\nSortable.create(list, {\n  delay: 500,\n  chosenClass: \"chosen\"\n});\n```\n---\n#### `forceFallback` option\nIf set to `true`, the Fallback for non HTML5 Browser will be used, even if we are using an HTML5 Browser.\nThis gives us the possibility to test the behaviour for older Browsers even in newer Browser, or make the Drag 'n Drop feel more consistent between Desktop , Mobile and old Browsers.\nOn top of that, the Fallback always generates a copy of that DOM Element and appends the class `fallbackClass` defined in the options. This behaviour controls the look of this 'dragged' Element.\nDemo: https://jsbin.com/sibiput/edit?html,css,js,output\n---\n#### `fallbackTolerance` option\nEmulates the native drag threshold. Specify in pixels how far the mouse should move before it's considered as a drag.\nUseful if the items are also clickable like in a list of links.\nWhen the user clicks inside a sortable element, it's not uncommon for your hand to move a little between the time you press and the time you release.\nDragging only starts if you move the pointer past a certain tolerance, so that you don't accidentally start dragging every time you click.\n3 to 5 are probably good values.\n---\n#### `dragoverBubble` option\nIf set to `true`, the dragover event will bubble to parent sortables. Works on both fallback and native dragover event.\nBy default, it is false, but Sortable will only stop bubbling the event once the element has been inserted into a parent Sortable, or *can* be inserted into a parent Sortable, but isn't at that specific time (due to animation, etc).\nSince 1.8.0, you will probably want to leave this option as false. Before 1.8.0, it may need to be `true` for nested sortables to work.\n---\n#### `removeCloneOnHide` option\nIf set to `false`, the clone is hidden by having it's CSS `display` property set to `none`.\nBy default, this option is `true`, meaning Sortable will remove the cloned element from the DOM when it is supposed to be hidden.\n---\n#### `emptyInsertThreshold` option\nThe distance (in pixels) the mouse must be from an empty sortable while dragging for the drag element to be inserted into that sortable. Defaults to `5`. Set to `0` to disable this feature.\nDemo: https://jsbin.com/becavoj/edit?js,output\n---\n### Event object ([demo](https://jsbin.com/fogujiv/edit?js,output))\n - to:`HTMLElement` â list, in which moved element\n - from:`HTMLElement` â previous list\n - item:`HTMLElement` â dragged element\n - clone:`HTMLElement`\n - oldIndex:`Number|undefined` â old index within parent\n - newIndex:`Number|undefined` â new index within parent\n - oldDraggableIndex: `Number|undefined` â old index within parent, only counting draggable elements\n - newDraggableIndex: `Number|undefined` â new index within parent, only counting draggable elements\n - pullMode:`String|Boolean|undefined` â Pull mode if dragging into another sortable (`\"clone\"`, `true`, or `false`), otherwise undefined\n#### `move` event object\n - to:`HTMLElement`\n - from:`HTMLElement`\n - dragged:`HTMLElement`\n - draggedRect:`DOMRect`\n - related:`HTMLElement` â element on which have guided\n - relatedRect:`DOMRect`\n - willInsertAfter:`Boolean` â `true` if will element be inserted after target (or `false` if before)\n---\n### Method\n##### option(name:`String`[, value:`*`]):`*`\nGet or set the option.\n##### closest(el:`String`[, selector:`HTMLElement`]):`HTMLElement|null`\nFor each element in the set, get the first element that matches the selector by testing the element itself and traversing up through its ancestors in the DOM tree.\n##### toArray():`String[]`\nSerializes the sortable's item `data-id`'s (`dataIdAttr` option) into an array of string.\n##### sort(order:`String[]`)\nSorts the elements according to the array.\n```js\nvar order = sortable.toArray();\nsortable.sort(order.reverse()); // apply\n```\n##### save()\nSave the current sorting (see [store](#store))\n##### destroy()\nRemoves the sortable functionality completely.\n---\n<a name=\"store\"></a>\n### Store\nSaving and restoring of the sort.\n```html\n<ul>\n\t<li data-id=\"1\">order</li>\n\t<li data-id=\"2\">save</li>\n\t<li data-id=\"3\">restore</li>\n</ul>\n```\n```js\nSortable.create(el, {\n\tgroup: \"localStorage-example\",\n\tstore: {\n\t\t/**\n\t\t * Get the order of elements.

Subject to the terms and conditions of\n      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,\n      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable\n      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,\n      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,\n      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable\n      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their\n      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)\n      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You\n      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\n      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\n      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\n      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\n      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n      as of the date such litigation is filed.\n   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS"},{"name":"thrift","version":"0.16.0","licenses":["Apache 2.0"],"texts":"","notice":""},{"name":"throttle-debounce","version":"2.1.0","licenses":["MIT"],"texts":"Copyright (c) Ivan NikoliÄ <http://ivannikolic.com>\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n        GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n          NO WARRANTY\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.","notice":""},{"name":"through2","version":"2.0.5","licenses":["MIT"],"texts":"# The MIT License (MIT)\n**Copyright (c) Rod Vagg (the \"Original Author\") and additional contributors**\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Request represents an HTTP request object, response represents an HTTP response, and Hydra manages making parallel HTTP connections.\n```ruby\nrequest = Typhoeus::Request.new(\n  \"www.example.com\",\n  method: :post,\n  body: \"this is a request body\",\n  params: { field1: \"a field\" },\n  headers: { Accept: \"text/html\" }\n)\n```\nWe can see from this that the first argument is the url. The second is a set of options.\nThe options are all optional. The default for `:method` is `:get`.\nWhen you want to send URL parameters, you can use `:params` hash to do so. Please note that in case of you should send a request via `x-www-form-urlencoded` parameters, you need to use `:body` hash instead. `params` are for URL parameters and `:body` is for the request body.\n#### Sending requests through the proxy\nAdd a proxy url to the list of options:\n```ruby\noptions = {proxy: 'http://myproxy.org'}\nreq = Typhoeus::Request.new(url, options)\n```\nIf your proxy requires authentication, add it with `proxyuserpwd` option key:\n```ruby\noptions = {proxy: 'http://proxyurl.com', proxyuserpwd: 'user:password'}\nreq = Typhoeus::Request.new(url, options)\n```\nNote that `proxyuserpwd` is a colon-separated username and password, in the vein of basic auth `userpwd` option.\nYou can run the query either on its own or through the hydra:\n``` ruby\nrequest.run\n#=> <Typhoeus::Response ... >\n```\n```ruby\nhydra = Typhoeus::Hydra.hydra\nhydra.queue(request)\nhydra.run\n```\nThe response object will be set after the request is run.\n```ruby\nresponse = request.response\nresponse.code\nresponse.total_time\nresponse.headers\nresponse.body\n```\n### Making Quick Requests\nTyphoeus has some convenience methods for performing single HTTP requests. The arguments are the same as those you pass into the request constructor.\n```ruby\nTyphoeus.get(\"www.example.com\")\nTyphoeus.head(\"www.example.com\")\nTyphoeus.put(\"www.example.com/posts/1\", body: \"whoo, a body\")\nTyphoeus.patch(\"www.example.com/posts/1\", body: \"a new body\")\nTyphoeus.post(\"www.example.com/posts\", body: { title: \"test post\", content: \"this is my test\"})\nTyphoeus.delete(\"www.example.com/posts/1\")\nTyphoeus.options(\"www.example.com\")\n```\n#### Sending params in the body with PUT\nWhen using POST the content-type is set automatically to 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'. That's not the case for any other method like PUT, PATCH, HEAD and so on,  irrespective of whether you are using body or not. To get the same result as POST, i.e. a hash in the body coming through as params in the receiver, you need to set the content-type as shown below:\n```ruby\nTyphoeus.put(\"www.example.com/posts/1\",\n        headers: {'Content-Type'=> \"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\"},\n        body: {title:\"test post updated title\", content: \"this is my updated content\"}\n    )\n```\n### Handling HTTP errors\nYou can query the response object to figure out if you had a successful\nrequest or not. Hereâs some example code that you might use to handle errors.\nThe callbacks are executed right after the request is finished, make sure to define\nthem before running the request.\n```ruby\nrequest = Typhoeus::Request.new(\"www.example.com\", followlocation: true)\nrequest.on_complete do |response|\n  if response.success?\n    # hell yeah\n  elsif response.timed_out?\n    # aw hell no\n    log(\"got a time out\")\n  elsif response.code == 0\n    # Could not get an http response, something's wrong.\n    log(response.return_message)\n  else\n    # Received a non-successful http response.\n    log(\"HTTP request failed: \" + response.code.to_s)\n  end\nend\nrequest.run\n```\nThis also works with serial (blocking) requests in the same fashion. Both\nserial and parallel requests return a Response object.\n### Handling file uploads\nA File object can be passed as a param for a POST request to handle uploading\nfiles to the server. Typhoeus will upload the file as the original file name\nand use Mime::Types to set the content type.\n```ruby\nTyphoeus.post(\n  \"http://localhost:3000/posts\",\n  body: {\n    title: \"test post\",\n    content: \"this is my test\",\n    file: File.open(\"thesis.txt\",\"r\")\n  }\n)\n```\n### Streaming the response body\nTyphoeus can stream responses. When you're expecting a large response,\nset the `on_body` callback on a request. Typhoeus will yield to the callback\nwith chunks of the response, as they're read. When you set an `on_body` callback,\nTyphoeus will not store the complete response.\n```ruby\ndownloaded_file = File.open 'huge.iso', 'wb'\nrequest = Typhoeus::Request.new(\"www.example.com/huge.iso\")\nrequest.on_headers do |response|\n  if response.code != 200\n    raise \"Request failed\"\n  end\nend\nrequest.on_body do |chunk|\n  downloaded_file.write(chunk)\nend\nrequest.on_complete do |response|\n  downloaded_file.close\n  # Note that response.body is \"\"\nend\nrequest.run\n```\nIf you need to interrupt the stream halfway,\nyou can return the `:abort` symbol from the `on_body` block, example:\n```ruby\nrequest.on_body do |chunk|\n  buffer << chunk\n  :abort if buffer.size > 1024 * 1024\nend\n```\nThis will properly stop the stream internally and avoid any memory leak which\nmay happen if you interrupt with something like a `return`, `throw` or `raise`.\n### Making Parallel Requests\nGenerally, you should be running requests through hydra. Here is how that looks:\n```ruby\nhydra = Typhoeus::Hydra.hydra\nfirst_request = Typhoeus::Request.new(\"http://example.com/posts/1\")\nfirst_request.on_complete do |response|\n  third_url = response.body\n  third_request = Typhoeus::Request.new(third_url)\n  hydra.queue third_request\nend\nsecond_request = Typhoeus::Request.new(\"http://example.com/posts/2\")\nhydra.queue first_request\nhydra.queue second_request\nhydra.run # this is a blocking call that returns once all requests are complete\n```\nThe execution of that code goes something like this. The first and second requests are built and queued. When hydra is run the first and second requests run in parallel. When the first request completes, the third request is then built and queued, in this example based on the result of the first request. The moment it is queued Hydra starts executing it.  Meanwhile the second request would continue to run (or it could have completed before the first). Once the third request is done, `hydra.run` returns.\nHow to get an array of response bodies back after executing a queue:\n```ruby\nhydra = Typhoeus::Hydra.new\nrequests = 10.times.map {\n  request = Typhoeus::Request.new(\"www.example.com\", followlocation: true)\n  hydra.queue(request)\n  request\n}\nhydra.run\nresponses = requests.map { |request|\n  request.response.body\n}\n```\n`hydra.run` is a blocking request. You can also use the `on_complete` callback to handle each request as it completes:\n```ruby\nhydra = Typhoeus::Hydra.new\n10.times do\n  request = Typhoeus::Request.new(\"www.example.com\", followlocation: true)\n  request.on_complete do |response|\n    #do_something_with response\n  end\n  hydra.queue(request)\nend\nhydra.run\n```\n### Making Parallel Requests with Faraday + Typhoeus\n```ruby\nrequire 'faraday'\nconn = Faraday.new(:url => 'http://httppage.com') do |builder|\n  builder.request  :url_encoded\n  builder.response :logger\n  builder.adapter  :typhoeus\nend\nconn.in_parallel do\n  response1 = conn.get('/first')\n  response2 = conn.get('/second')\n  # these will return nil here since the\n  # requests have not been completed\n  response1.body\n  response2.body\nend\n# after it has been completed the response information is fully available\n# response1.status, etc\nresponse1.body\nresponse2.body\n```\n### Specifying Max Concurrency\nHydra will also handle how many requests you can make in parallel. Things will get flakey if you try to make too many requests at the same time. The built in limit is 200. When more requests than that are queued up, hydra will save them for later and start the requests as others are finished. You can raise or lower the concurrency limit through the Hydra constructor.\n```ruby\nTyphoeus::Hydra.new(max_concurrency: 20)\n```\n### Memoization\nHydra memoizes requests within a single run call. You have to enable memoization.\nThis will result in a single request being issued. However, the on_complete handlers of both will be called.\n```ruby\nTyphoeus::Config.memoize = true\nhydra = Typhoeus::Hydra.new(max_concurrency: 1)\n2.times do\n  hydra.queue Typhoeus::Request.new(\"www.example.com\")\nend\nhydra.run\n```\nThis will result in two requests.\n```ruby\nTyphoeus::Config.memoize = false\nhydra = Typhoeus::Hydra.new(max_concurrency: 1)\n2.times do\n  hydra.queue Typhoeus::Request.new(\"www.example.com\")\nend\nhydra.run\n```\n### Caching\nTyphoeus includes built in support for caching. In the following example, if there is a cache hit, the cached object is passed to the on_complete handler of the request object.\n```ruby\nclass Cache\n  def initialize\n    @memory = {}\n  end\n  def get(request)\n    @memory[request]\n  end\n  def set(request, response)\n    @memory[request] = response\n  end\nend\nTyphoeus::Config.cache = Cache.new\nTyphoeus.get(\"www.example.com\").cached?\n#=> false\nTyphoeus.get(\"www.example.com\").cached?\n#=> true\n```\nFor use with [Dalli](https://github.com/mperham/dalli):\n```ruby\ndalli = Dalli::Client.new(...)\nTyphoeus::Config.cache = Typhoeus::Cache::Dalli.new(dalli)\n```\nFor use with Rails:\n```ruby\nTyphoeus::Config.cache = Typhoeus::Cache::Rails.new\n```\nFor use with [Redis](https://github.com/redis/redis-rb):\n```ruby\nredis = Redis.new(...)\nTyphoeus::Config.cache = Typhoeus::Cache::Redis.new(redis)\n```\nAll three of these adapters take an optional keyword argument `default_ttl`, which sets a default\nTTL on cached responses (in seconds), for requests which do not have a cache TTL set.\nYou may also selectively choose not to cache by setting `cache` to `false` on a request or to use\na different adapter.\n```ruby\ncache = Cache.new\nTyphoeus.get(\"www.example.com\", cache: cache)\n```\n### Direct Stubbing\nHydra allows you to stub out specific urls and patterns to avoid hitting\nremote servers while testing.\n```ruby\nresponse = Typhoeus::Response.new(code: 200, body: \"{'name' : 'paul'}\")\nTyphoeus.stub('www.example.com').and_return(response)\nTyphoeus.get(\"www.example.com\") == response\n#=> true\n```\nThe queued request will hit the stub. You can also specify a regex to match urls.\n```ruby\nresponse = Typhoeus::Response.new(code: 200, body: \"{'name' : 'paul'}\")\nTyphoeus.stub(/example/).and_return(response)\nTyphoeus.get(\"www.example.com\") == response\n#=> true\n```\nYou may also specify an array for the stub to return sequentially.\n```ruby\nTyphoeus.stub('www.example.com').and_return([response1, response2])\nTyphoeus.get('www.example.com') == response1 #=> true\nTyphoeus.get('www.example.com') == response2 #=> true\n```\nWhen testing make sure to clear your expectations or the stubs will persist between tests. The following can be included in your spec_helper.rb file to do this automatically.\n```ruby\nRSpec.configure do |config|\n  config.before :each do\n    Typhoeus::Expectation.clear\n  end\nend\n```\n### Timeouts\nNo exceptions are raised on HTTP timeouts. You can check whether a request timed out with the following method:\n```ruby\nTyphoeus.get(\"www.example.com\", timeout: 1).timed_out?\n```\nTimed out responses also have their success? method return false.\nThere are two different timeouts available: [`timeout`](http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/curl_easy_setopt.html#CURLOPTTIMEOUT)\nand [`connecttimeout`](http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/curl_easy_setopt.html#CURLOPTCONNECTTIMEOUT).\n`timeout` is the time limit for the entire request in seconds.\n`connecttimeout` is the time limit for just the connection phase, again in seconds.\nThere are two additional more fine grained options `timeout_ms` and\n`connecttimeout_ms`. These options offer millisecond precision but are not always available (for instance on linux if `nosignal` is not set to true).\nWhen you pass a floating point `timeout` (or `connecttimeout`) Typhoeus will set `timeout_ms` for you if it has not been defined. The actual timeout values passed to curl will always be rounded up.\nDNS timeouts of less than one second are not supported unless curl is compiled with an asynchronous resolver.\nThe default `timeout` is 0 (zero) which means curl never times out during transfer. The default `connecttimeout` is 300 seconds. A `connecttimeout` of 0 will also result in the default `connecttimeout` of 300 seconds.\n### Following Redirections\nUse `followlocation: true`, eg:\n```ruby\nTyphoeus.get(\"www.example.com\", followlocation: true)\n```\n### Basic Authentication\n```ruby\nTyphoeus::Request.get(\"www.example.com\", userpwd: \"user:password\")\n```\n### Compression\n```ruby\nTyphoeus.get(\"www.example.com\", accept_encoding: \"gzip\")\n```\nThe above has a different behavior than setting the header directly in the header hash, eg:\n```ruby\nTyphoeus.get(\"www.example.com\", headers: {\"Accept-Encoding\" => \"gzip\"})\n```\nSetting the header hash directly will not include the `--compressed` flag in the libcurl command and therefore libcurl will not decompress the response.  If you want the `--compressed` flag to be added automatically, set `:accept_encoding` Typhoeus option.\n### Cookies\n```ruby\nTyphoeus::Request.get(\"www.example.com\", cookiefile: \"/path/to/file\", cookiejar: \"/path/to/file\")\n```\nHere, `cookiefile` is a file to read cookies from, and `cookiejar` is a file to write received cookies to.\nIf you just want cookies enabled, you need to pass the same filename for both options.\n### Other CURL options\nAre available and documented [here](http://rubydoc.info/github/typhoeus/ethon/Ethon/Easy/Options)\n### SSL\nSSL comes built in to libcurl so itâs in Typhoeus as well. If you pass in a\nurl with \"https\" it should just work assuming that you have your [cert\nbundle](http://curl.haxx.se/docs/caextract.html) in order and the server is\nverifiable. You must also have libcurl built with SSL support enabled. You can\ncheck that by doing this:\n```\ncurl --version\n```\nNow, even if you have libcurl built with OpenSSL you may still have a messed\nup cert bundle or if youâre hitting a non-verifiable SSL server then youâll\nhave to disable peer verification to make SSL work. Like this:\n```ruby\nTyphoeus.get(\"https://www.example.com\", ssl_verifypeer: false)\n```\nIf you are getting \"SSL: certificate subject name does not match target host\nname\" from curl (ex:- you are trying to access to b.c.host.com when the\ncertificate subject is \\*.host.com). You can disable host verification. Like\nthis:\n```ruby\n# host checking enabled\nTyphoeus.get(\"https://www.example.com\", ssl_verifyhost: 2)\n# host checking disabled\nTyphoeus.get(\"https://www.example.com\", ssl_verifyhost: 0)\n```\n### Verbose debug output\nItâs sometimes useful to see verbose output from curl. You can enable it on a per-request basis:\n```ruby\nTyphoeus.get(\"http://example.com\", verbose: true)\n```\nor globally:\n```ruby\nTyphoeus::Config.verbose = true\n```\nJust remember that libcurl prints itâs debug output to the console (to\nSTDERR), so youâll need to run your scripts from the console to see it.\n### Default User Agent Header\nIn many cases, all HTTP requests made by an application require the same User-Agent header set. Instead of supplying it on a per-request basis by supplying a custom header, it is possible to override it for all requests using:\n```ruby\nTyphoeus::Config.user_agent = \"custom user agent\"\n```\n### Running the specs\nRunning the specs should be as easy as:\n```\nbundle install\nbundle exec rake\n```\n## Semantic Versioning\nThis project conforms to [semver](http://semver.org/).\n## LICENSE\n(The MIT License)\nCopyright Â© 2009-2010 [Paul Dix](http://www.pauldix.net/)\nCopyright Â© 2011-2012 [David Balatero](https://github.com/dbalatero/)\nCopyright Â© 2012-2016 [Hans Hasselberg](http://github.com/i0rek/)\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a\ncopy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"),\nto deal in the Software without restriction, including without\nlimitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute,\nsublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons\nto whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included\nin all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

There are two options:\n1. A zoneinfo directory containing timezone definition files. These files are\n   generated from the [IANA Time Zone Database](https://www.iana.org/time-zones)\n   using the `zic` utility. Most Unix-like systems include a zoneinfo directory.\n2. The TZInfo::Data library (the tzinfo-data gem). TZInfo::Data contains a set\n   of Ruby modules that are also generated from the IANA Time Zone Database.\nBy default, TZInfo will attempt to use TZInfo::Data. If TZInfo::Data is not\navailable (i.e. if `require 'tzinfo/data'` fails), then TZInfo will search for a\nzoneinfo directory instead (using the search path specified by\n`TZInfo::ZoneinfoDataSource::DEFAULT_SEARCH_PATH`).\nIf no data source can be found, a `TZInfo::DataSourceNotFound` exception will be\nraised when TZInfo is used. Further information is available\n[in the wiki](https://tzinfo.github.io/datasourcenotfound) to help resolve\n`TZInfo::DataSourceNotFound` errors.\nThe default data source selection can be overridden by calling\n`TZInfo::DataSource.set`.\nCustom data sources can also be used. See the `TZInfo::DataSource.set`\ndocumentation for further details.\n## Installation\nThe TZInfo gem can be installed by running `gem install tzinfo` or by adding\n`gem 'tzinfo'` to your `Gemfile` and running `bundle install`.\nTo use the Ruby modules as the data source, TZInfo::Data will also need to be\ninstalled by running `gem install tzinfo-data` or by adding `gem 'tzinfo-data'`\nto your `Gemfile`.\n## IANA Time Zone Database\nThe data returned and used by TZInfo is sourced from the\n[IANA Time Zone Database](http://www.iana.org/time-zones). The\n[Theory and pragmatics of the tz code and data](https://data.iana.org/time-zones/theory.html)\ndocument gives details of how the data is organized and managed.\n## Example Usage\nTo use TZInfo, it must first be required with:\n```ruby\nrequire 'tzinfo'\n```\nThe `TZInfo::Timezone` class provides access to time zone data and methods for\nconverting times.\nThe `all_identifiers` method returns a list of valid time zone identifiers:\n```ruby\nidentifiers = TZInfo::Timezone.all_identifiers\n# => [\"Africa/Adibdjan\", \"Africa/Accra\", ..., \"Zulu\"]\n```\nA `TZInfo::Timezone` instance representing an individual time zone can be\nobtained with `TZInfo::Timezone.get`:\n```ruby\ntz = TZInfo::Timezone.get('America/New_York')\n# => #<TZInfo::DataTimezone: America/New_York>\n```\nA time can be converted to the local time of the time zone with `to_local`:\n```ruby\ntz.to_local(Time.utc(2018, 2, 1, 12, 30, 0))\n# => 2018-02-01 07:30:00 -0500\ntz.to_local(Time.utc(2018, 7, 1, 12, 30, 0))\n# => 2018-07-01 08:30:00 -0400\ntz.to_local(Time.new(2018, 7, 1, 13, 30, 0, '+01:00'))\n# => 2018-07-01 08:30:00 -0400\n```\nLocal times with the appropriate offset for the time zone can be constructed\nwith `local_time`:\n```ruby\ntz.local_time(2018, 2, 1, 7, 30, 0)\n# => 2018-02-01 07:30:00 -0500\ntz.local_time(2018, 7, 1, 8, 30, 0)\n# => 2018-07-01 08:30:00 -0400\n```\nLocal times can be converted to UTC by using `local_time` and calling `utc` on\nthe result:\n```ruby\ntz.local_time(2018, 2, 1, 7, 30, 0).utc\n# => 2018-02-01 12:30:00 UTC\ntz.local_time(2018, 7, 1, 8, 30, 0).utc\n# => 2018-07-01 12:30:00 UTC\n```\nThe `local_to_utc` method can also be used to convert a time object to UTC. The\noffset of the time is ignored - it is treated as if it were a local time for the\ntime zone:\n```ruby\ntz.local_to_utc(Time.utc(2018, 2, 1, 7, 30, 0))\n# => 2018-02-01 12:30:00 UTC\ntz.local_to_utc(Time.new(2018, 2, 1, 7, 30, 0, '+01:00'))\n# => 2018-02-01 12:30:00 UTC\n```\nInformation about the time zone can be obtained from returned local times:\n```ruby\nlocal_time = tz.to_local(Time.utc(2018, 2, 1, 12, 30, 0))\nlocal_time.utc_offset  # => -18000\nlocal_time.dst?        # => false\nlocal_time.zone        # => \"EST\"\nlocal_time = tz.to_local(Time.utc(2018, 7, 1, 12, 30, 0))\nlocal_time.utc_offset  # => -14400\nlocal_time.dst?        # => true\nlocal_time.zone        # => \"EDT\"\n```\nTime zone information can be included when formatting times with `strftime`\nusing the `%z` and `%Z` directives:\n```ruby\ntz.to_local(Time.utc(2018, 2, 1, 12, 30, 0)).strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %z %Z')\n# => \"2018-02-01 07:30:00 -0500 EST\"\ntz.to_local(Time.utc(2018, 7, 1, 12, 30, 0)).strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %z %Z')\n# => \"2018-07-01 08:30:00 -0400 EDT\"\n```\nThe `period_for` method can be used to obtain information about the observed\ntime zone information at a particular time as a `TZInfo::TimezonePeriod` object:\n```ruby\nperiod = tz.period_for(Time.utc(2018, 7, 1, 12, 30, 0))\nperiod.base_utc_offset          # => -18000\nperiod.std_offset               # => 3600\nperiod.observed_utc_offset      # => -14400\nperiod.abbreviation             # => \"EDT\"\nperiod.dst?                     # => true\nperiod.local_starts_at.to_time  # => 2018-03-11 03:00:00 -0400\nperiod.local_ends_at.to_time    # => 2018-11-04 02:00:00 -0400\n```\nA list of transitions between periods where different rules are observed can be\nobtained with the `transitions_up_to` method. The result is returned as an\n`Array` of `TZInfo::TimezoneTransition` objects:\n```ruby\ntransitions = tz.transitions_up_to(Time.utc(2019, 1, 1), Time.utc(2017, 1, 1))\ntransitions.map do |t|\n  [t.local_end_at.to_time, t.offset.observed_utc_offset, t.offset.abbreviation]\nend\n# => [[2017-03-12 02:00:00 -0500, -14400, \"EDT\"],\n#     [2017-11-05 02:00:00 -0400, -18000, \"EST\"],\n#     [2018-03-11 02:00:00 -0500, -14400, \"EDT\"],\n#     [2018-11-04 02:00:00 -0400, -18000, \"EST\"]]\n```\nA list of the unique offsets used by a time zone can be obtained with the\n`offsets_up_to` method. The result is returned as an `Array` of\n`TZInfo::TimezoneOffset` objects:\n```ruby\noffsets = tz.offsets_up_to(Time.utc(2019, 1, 1))\noffsets.map {|o| [o.observed_utc_offset, o.abbreviation] }\n# => [[-17762, \"LMT\"],\n#     [-18000, \"EST\"],\n#     [-14400, \"EDT\"],\n#     [-14400, \"EWT\"],\n#     [-14400, \"EPT\"]]\n```\nAll `TZInfo::Timezone` methods that accept a time as a parameter can be used\nwith either instances of `Time`, `DateTime` or `TZInfo::Timestamp`. Arbitrary\n`Time`-like objects that respond to both `to_i` and `subsec` and optionally\n`utc_offset` will be treated as if they are instances of `Time`.\n`TZInfo::Timezone` methods that both accept and return times will return an\nobject with a type matching that of the parameter (actually a\n`TZInfo::TimeWithOffset`, `TZInfo::DateTimeWithOffset` or\n`TZInfo::TimestampWithOffset` subclass when returning a local time):\n```ruby\ntz.to_local(Time.utc(2018, 7, 1, 12, 30, 0))\n# => 2018-07-01 08:30:00 -0400\ntz.to_local(DateTime.new(2018, 7, 1, 12, 30, 0))\n# => #<TZInfo::DateTimeWithOffset: 2018-07-01T08:30:00-04:00 ((2458301j,45000s,0n),-14400s,2299161j)>\ntz.to_local(TZInfo::Timestamp.create(2018, 7, 1, 12, 30, 0, 0, :utc))\n# => #<TZInfo::TimestampWithOffset: @value=1530448200, @sub_second=0, @utc_offset=-14400, @utc=false>\n```\nIn addition to `local_time`, which returns `Time` instances, the\n`local_datetime` and `local_timestamp` methods can be used to construct local\n`DateTime` and `TZInfo::Timestamp` instances with the appropriate offset:\n```ruby\ntz.local_time(2018, 2, 1, 7, 30, 0)\n# => 2018-02-01 07:30:00 -0500\ntz.local_datetime(2018, 2, 1, 7, 30, 0)\n# => #<TZInfo::DateTimeWithOffset: 2018-02-01T07:30:00-05:00 ((2458151j,45000s,0n),-18000s,2299161j)>\ntz.local_timestamp(2018, 2, 1, 7, 30, 0)\n# => #<TZInfo::TimestampWithOffset: @value=1517488200, @sub_second=0, @utc_offset=-18000, @utc=false>\n```\nThe `local_to_utc`, `local_time`, `local_datetime` and `local_timestamp` methods\nmay raise a `TZInfo::PeriodNotFound` or a `TZInfo::AmbiguousTime` exception.\n`TZInfo::PeriodNotFound` signals that there is no equivalent UTC time (for\nexample, during the transition from standard time to daylight savings time when\nthe clocks are moved forward and an hour is skipped). `TZInfo::AmbiguousTime`\nsignals that there is more than one equivalent UTC time (for example, during the\ntransition from daylight savings time to standard time where the clocks are\nmoved back and an hour is repeated):\n```ruby\ntz.local_time(2018, 3, 11, 2, 30, 0, 0)\n# raises TZInfo::PeriodNotFound (2018-03-11 02:30:00 is an invalid local time.)\ntz.local_time(2018, 11, 4, 1, 30, 0, 0)\n# raises TZInfo::AmbiguousTime (2018-11-04 01:30:00 is an ambiguous local time.)\n```\n`TZInfo::PeriodNotFound` exceptions can only be resolved by adjusting the time,\nfor example, by advancing an hour:\n```ruby\ntz.local_time(2018, 3, 11, 3, 30, 0, 0)\n# => 2018-03-11 03:30:00 -0400\n```\n`TZInfo::AmbiguousTime` exceptions can be resolved by setting the `dst`\nparameter and/or specifying a block to choose one of the interpretations:\n```ruby\ntz.local_time(2018, 11, 4, 1, 30, 0, 0, true)\n# => 2018-11-04 01:30:00 -0400\ntz.local_time(2018, 11, 4, 1, 30, 0, 0, false)\n# => 2018-11-04 01:30:00 -0500\ntz.local_time(2018, 11, 4, 1, 30, 0, 0) {|p| p.first }\n# => 2018-11-04 01:30:00 -0400\ntz.local_time(2018, 11, 4, 1, 30, 0, 0) {|p| p.last }\n# => 2018-11-04 01:30:00 -0500\n```\nThe default value of the `dst` parameter can also be set globally:\n```ruby\nTZInfo::Timezone.default_dst = true\ntz.local_time(2018, 11, 4, 1, 30, 0, 0)\n# => 2018-11-04 01:30:00 -0400\nTZInfo::Timezone.default_dst = false\ntz.local_time(2018, 11, 4, 1, 30, 0, 0)\n# => 2018-11-04 01:30:00 -0500\n```\nTZInfo also provides information about\n[ISO 3166-1](https://www.iso.org/iso-3166-country-codes.html) countries and\ntheir associated time zones via the `TZInfo::Country` class.\nA list of valid ISO 3166-1 (alpha-2) country codes can be obtained by calling\n`TZInfo::Country.all_codes`:\n```ruby\nTZInfo::Country.all_codes\n# => [\"AD\", \"AE\", ..., \"ZW\"]\n```\nA `TZInfo::Country` instance representing an individual time zone can be\nobtained with `TZInfo::Country.get`:\n```ruby\nc = TZInfo::Country.get('US')\n# => #<TZInfo::Country: US>\nc.name\n# => \"United States\"\n```\nThe `zone_identifiers` method returns a list of the time zone identifiers used\nin a country:\n```ruby\nc.zone_identifiers\n# => [\"America/New_York\", \"America/Detroit\", ..., \"Pacific/Honolulu\"]\n```\nThe `zone_info` method returns further information about the time zones used in\na country as an `Array` of `TZInfo::CountryTimezone` instances:\n```ruby\nzi = c.zone_info.first\nzi.identifier               # => \"America/New_York\"\nzi.latitude.to_f.round(5)   # => 40.71417\nzi.longitude.to_f.round(5)  # => -74.00639\nzi.description              # => \"Eastern (most areas)\"\n```\nThe `zones` method returns an `Array` of `TZInfo::Timezone` instances for a\ncountry. A `TZInfo::Timezone` instance can be obtained from a\n`TZInfo::CountryTimezone` using the `timezone` method:\n```ruby\nzi.timezone.to_local(Time.utc(2018, 2, 1, 12, 30, 0))\n# => 2018-02-01 07:30:00 -0500\n```\nFor further detail, please refer to the API documentation for the\n`TZInfo::Timezone` and `TZInfo::Country` classes.\n## Time Zone Selection\nThe Time Zone Database maintainers recommend that time zone identifiers are not\nmade visible to end-users (see [Names of\ntimezones](https://data.iana.org/time-zones/theory.html#naming)).\nInstead of displaying a list of time zone identifiers, time zones can be\nselected by the user's country. Call `TZInfo::Country.all` to obtain a list of\n`TZInfo::Country` objects, each with a unique `code` and a `name` that can be\nused for display purposes.\nMost countries have a single time zone. When choosing such a country, the time\nzone can be inferred and selected automatically.\n```ruby\ncroatia = TZInfo::Country.get('HR')\n# => #<TZInfo::Country: HR>\ncroatia.zone_info.length\n# => 1\ncroatia.zone_info[0].identifier\n# => \"Europe/Belgrade\"\n```\nSome countries have multiple time zones. The `zone_info` method can be used\nto obtain a list of user-friendly descriptions of the available options:\n```ruby\naustralia = TZInfo::Country.get('AU')\n# => #<TZInfo::Country: AU>\naustralia.zone_info.length\n# => 13\naustralia.zone_info.map {|i| [i.identifier, i.description] }\n# => [[\"Australia/Lord_Howe\", \"Lord Howe Island\"],\n#     [\"Antarctica/Macquarie\", \"Macquarie Island\"],\n#     ...\n#     [\"Australia/Eucla\", \"Western Australia (Eucla)\"]]\n```\nPlease note that country information available through TZInfo is intended as an\naid to help users select a time zone data appropriate for their practical needs.\nIt is not intended to take or endorse any position on legal or territorial\nclaims.\n## Compatibility\nTZInfo v2.0.0 requires a minimum of Ruby MRI 1.9.3 or JRuby 1.7 (in 1.9 mode or\nlater).\n## Thread-Safety\nThe `TZInfo::Country` and `TZInfo::Timezone` classes are thread-safe. It is safe\nto use class and instance methods of `TZInfo::Country` and `TZInfo::Timezone` in\nconcurrently executing threads. Instances of both classes can be shared across\nthread boundaries.\n## Documentation\nAPI documentation for TZInfo is available on\n[RubyDoc.info](https://www.rubydoc.info/gems/tzinfo/).\n## License\nTZInfo is released under the MIT license, see LICENSE for details.\n## Source Code\nSource code for TZInfo is available on\n[GitHub](https://github.com/tzinfo/tzinfo).\n## Issue Tracker\nPlease post any bugs, issues, feature requests or questions about TZInfo to the\n[GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/tzinfo/tzinfo/issues).\nIssues with the underlying time zone data should be raised on the\n[Time Zone Database Discussion mailing list](https://mm.icann.org/mailman/listinfo/tz).\nCopyright (c) 2005-2022 Philip Ross\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\nthis software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies\nof the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do\nso, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n   5.

Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n   7.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"{}\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n   5.

Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n   7.

In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

You may add Your own attribution\n       notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n       or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n       that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n       as modifying the License.\n   You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n   may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n   for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n   for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n   reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n   the conditions stated in this License.\n5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n   any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n   by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n   this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n   Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n   the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n   with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n   names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n   except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n   origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n   agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n   Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n   risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n   of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\nAPPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n   To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n   boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n   replaced with your own identifying information.
